---

<ReleaseNote date="2020-12-30" title="United Kingdom will no longer be flagged is_in_european_union">
Effective January 5, 2021, the `is_in_european_union` flag will no longer be
marked true for locations in the United Kingdom. This change will be reflected
in the data in GeoLite2 databases and web services, GeoIP2 databases, GeoIP2
Precision web services, and minFraud Insights and Factors services.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-10-20" title="New Output is_residential_proxy Released for GeoIP2 Precision Insights Web Service, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors">
We have released an additional output for our web services. [GeoIP2 Precision
Insights](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services), [minFraud
Insights, and minFraud
Factors](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services) customers can
now see whether an IP address is likely a [residential
proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Residential_proxy):

- `/traits/is_residential_proxy` – This is true if the IP address is on a
suspected anonymizing network and belongs to a residential ISP. Otherwise,
the key is not included in the traits object.

Our [client APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis)
have been updated to support these outputs so may need to refresh yours if you
are not interfacing directly with our REST API.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-10-12" title="IP Address Optional in minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors Services">
Effective October 12, 2020 we are making the IP address input optional for all
minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors queries. If you use these minFraud
services for transactions where the IP address is not relevant (e.g. a phone
order placed through a call center), you no longer need to include an IP
address with your request. Note that the more data you send (including IP
addresses, when applicable), the better the scoring the minFraud service will
provide. See the [relevant FAQ on our Support
Center](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-faq/minfraud-services/can-i-use-minfraud-to-score-a-transaction-where-the-ip-address-is-not-available-or-not-relevant/)
for more information.

<ReleaseNote date="2020-09-14" title="Email Now Available as Custom Rules Parameter">
We have released an additional input parameter for use with custom rules.
Customers of [minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud
Factors](/minfraud) can now use email address to serve as the basis when
creating a custom rule:

- Email address: `/email/address/` – a valid email address or an MD5 of the
lowercased email used in the transaction.

For more information on implementing custom rules, see the [Custom Rules Guide
on our Support Center](https://support.maxmind.com/custom-rules-guide/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-09-10" title="Billing and Product/Service Permission Types for Standard Users">
We have added a new permission category for the Standard User type. The
Product/Service permission grants a Standard User access to product and service
related functionality in the account portal without having access to user
management and billing functionality. For more information, consult our
[Multi-User Account Access
Guide](https://support.maxmind.com/multi-user-account-access/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-08-10" title="Update to minFraud service server locations">
Effective August 17, 2020, we will no longer serve minFraud service queries
from our London-area servers. These queries will automatically be re-routed to
our US-East servers. You do not need to take any action as a result of this
change. Customers who have previously had queries routed to these servers may
see an increase of 100 – 150 ms in the response time for your queries.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-08-06" title="New minFraud Factors subscores">
We have released three additional subscore outputs. Customers of [minFraud
Factors](/minfraud) can now access the following subscores:

- `/subscores/device` – Risk associated with the device.
- `/subscores/email_local_part` – Risk associated with the part of the email
before the @ symbol.
- `/subscores/shipping_address` – Risk associated with the shipping address.

Our [client APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis)
have been updated to support these outputs so may need to refresh yours if you
are not interfacing directly with our rest API.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-06-24" title="Report transaction support in minFraud client APIs">
The [minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors](/minfraud) client APIs now support
sending transaction feedback to our [Report Transaction
endpoint](/minfraud/report-a-transaction). This will allow you to more
easily report fraud, suspected fraud, spam/abuse, and false positives to
improve scoring. You can find more details on using this functionality in the
[documentation for the specific client API you
use](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-06-22" title="FIDO2 Support for Two-Factor Authentication">
We've updated our Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) implementation to the [FIDO2
standard](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/), which supports more web browsers
and more types of security keys (e.g. supported biometrics keys). See our
[Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) User Guide for more
information](https://support.maxmind.com/two-factor-authentication-2fa-user-guide/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-06-15" title="Data Changes to GeoIP Legacy and minFraud Legacy Web Services">
We are planning to make a number of data changes to the minFraud Legacy
Standard and Premium, and GeoIP Legacy City and Insights (formerly Omni) web
services at the end of May 2022. Please see our [blog
post](https://blog.maxmind.com/2020/06/15/data-changes-to-geoip-legacy-and-minfraud-legacy-web-services-in-may-2022/)
for more information, and how to prepare.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-05-14" title="Anonymous IP flags as parameters for custom rules">
Customers of [minFraud Insights and minFraud Factors](/minfraud) can now use
the following [Anonymous IP outputs](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits) as parameters to
serve as the basis when creating a custom rule:

- `/ip_address/traits/is_anonymous`
- `/ip_address/traits/is_anonymous_vpn`
- `/ip_address/traits/is_hosting_provider`
- `/ip_address/traits/is_public_proxy`
- `/ip_address/traits/is_tor_exit_node`
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-05-08" title="Retirement of legacy minFraud SOAP API">
On May 8, 2020, we discontinued our legacy minFraud SOAP API in order to focus
our development on our newer current APIs. We initially [announced this
retirement in April
2019](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/04/12/important-updates-about-tls-v1-0-v1-1-unencrypted-http-requests-and-the-legacy-minfraud-soap-api/).

Other [client APIs for legacy minFraud services](/minfraud/minfraud-legacy)
(not recommended) will continue to be supported. We recommend either
integrating with the [legacy minFraud service
directly](/minfraud/minfraud-legacy), or using our [current minFraud
services](/minfraud).

creating a custom rule:

- `/billing/address` – The first line of the user's billing address.
- `/billing/address_2` – The second line of the user's billing address.
- `/email/is_disposable` – This field is true if MaxMind believes that the
email address is from a disposable email provider. It is false if the address
is not from a known disposable email provider.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-04-06" title="New /credit_card/is_business output">

On January 31, 2020, we discontinued our legacy IIN (BIN) API in order to focus
development and maintenance efforts on our core services. The affected endpoint

spam/abuse, suspected fraud) directly from the Transaction Details screen for
an individual transaction in [minFraud
Interactive](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-interactive-manual-review-guide/).

Tagging transactions allows us to detect 10-50% more fraud for you. You may
also tag transactions outside of minFraud Interactive by using [this
