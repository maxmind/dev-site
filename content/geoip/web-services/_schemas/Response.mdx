  All services return data as a JSON document. The document that is returned
  always consists of an object (aka map or hash). Each key in the object in turn
  maps to an object or an array of objects.

  The exact set of top-level keys varies based on the particular GeoIP2
  Precision service you are using. If a key maps to an undefined or empty value,
  it is not included in the JSON object. This applies both to top-level keys and
  the objects they map to.

  The data returned in the document will be in UTF-8 encoding.
