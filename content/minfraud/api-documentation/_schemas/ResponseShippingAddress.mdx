    We use [GeoNames data](https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/postal-codes-us.html)
    for the postal-city match, which uses the [preferred place name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code#Preferred_place_names:_ZIP_Codes_and_previous_zoning_lines)
    for a US ZIP code. [Alternative place names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code#Preferred_place_names:_ZIP_Codes_and_previous_zoning_lines)
    for US ZIP codes may not trigger a match for this field.
