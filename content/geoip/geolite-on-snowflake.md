title: GeoLite on Snowflake
---

MaxMind offers our GeoLite data through the [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZ2FTZ5POF7/MaxMind). If you do not
have an existing Snowflake account, you will need to create one before
requesting access to the GeoLite datasets. Once approved, you will be able to
query GeoLite data within Snowflake.

The GeoLite Country and City datasets are updated twice weekly, every Tuesday
and Friday. The GeoLite ASN dataset is updated daily.

## IP geolocation accuracy

{{< alert warning >}}
**IP Geolocation Usage**

IP geolocation is inherently imprecise. Locations are often near the center of
the population. Any location provided by a GeoIP database should not be used to
identify a particular address or household.

{{</ alert >}}

Use the Accuracy Radius as an indication of geolocation accuracy for the
latitude and longitude coordinates we return for an IP address. The actual
location of the IP address is likely within the area defined by this radius and
the latitude and longitude coordinates.

## GeoLite dataset

The GeoLite dataset contains geolocation and ASN data depending on the
particular dataset you are querying:
