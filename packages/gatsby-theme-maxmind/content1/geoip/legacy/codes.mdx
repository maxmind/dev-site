title: GeoIP Legacy Codes
---

The page contains lists of the ISO 3166 and MaxMind-specific codes used by
legacy GeoIP products.

## ISO 3166 Country Codes

Below are ISO codes for countries in GeoIP legacy databases, with the addition
of MaxMind-specific codes for [Europe](#maxmind-specific-codes-for-europe),
[Asia Pacific Region](#maxmind-specific-codes-for-the-asiapacific-region),
Anonymous Proxy and Satellite Provider.

[Continents](#iso-3166-country-codes-with-associated-continent) for these countries.

Please note that `EU` and `AP` codes are only used when a specific country code
has not been designated. Blocking or re-directing by `EU` or `AP` will only
affect a small portion of IP addresses. Instead, you should list the countries
you want to block/re-direct individually.

Also, the `O1 Other Country` code is only used in the
[GeoIP City country subset](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-database-by-continent)
databases.

You may also [download these codes in CSV format](/static/csv/codes/iso3166.csv).
