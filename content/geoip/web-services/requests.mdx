title: GeoIP and GeoLite API Requests
---


## Authorization and Security

The HTTP `Authorization` header is required for authorization. The username is
your [MaxMind account ID](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).
The password is your [MaxMind license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).

<Alert type="warning">
  You must be approved for a trial or GeoLite2 account, or purchase credit for
  use with our web services in order to receive an account ID and license key.
</Alert>

We use [basic HTTP authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
The APIs which require authentication are only available via HTTPS. The
credentials are never transmitted unencrypted. If you attempt to access this
service via HTTP, you will receive a `403 Forbidden` HTTP response.

We require TLS 1.2 or greater for all requests to our servers to keep your data
secure.

## Service Endpoints

The endpoint for each service is as specified below. Each endpoint expects an
IP adddress to be defined as a path parameter (`{ip_address}`).

The IP address can be either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address. IPv4 addresses should
be passed in the standard dotted quad form, for example `1.2.3.4`. IPv6
addresses should be passed as strings as well. We recommend using the canonical
form as described in [RFC 5952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952), for
example `2001:db8::1:0:0:1`, but we will handle any valid IPv6 string
representation.

You can also use the string `me` as the IP address. In this case, the record for
the IP address you are querying from will be returned. This is useful when your
application does not have easy access to its public IP address, e.g., when the
system making the query is behind a NAT.

### GeoIP2 Endpoints
| Service  | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                                     |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Country  | `POST`      | `https://geoip.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/country/{ip_address}`  |
| City     | `POST`      | `https://geoip.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/city/{ip_address}`     |
| Insights | `POST`      | `https://geoip.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/insights/{ip_address}` |

The **geoip.maxmind.com** hostname automatically picks the data center
geographically closest to you.

### GeoLite2 Endpoints
| Service  | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                                |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Country  | `POST`      | `https://geolite.info/geoip/v2.1/country/{ip_address}`  |
| City     | `POST`      | `https://geolite.info/geoip/v2.1/city/{ip_address}`     |

The **geolite.info** hostname automatically picks the data center
geographically closest to you.

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Accept`
      </td>
      <td>
        **Optional** – If you do set this header, you must accept any of the
        following, substituting the appropriate `[SERVICE TYPE]` for either
        `city`, `country`, or `insights`:

        * `application/json`
        * `application/vnd.maxmind.com-[SERVICE TYPE]+json`
        * `application/vnd.maxmind.com-[SERVICE TYPE]+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`

        A request for any other MIME type will result in a `415 Unsupported Media Type` error.

    <tr>

        `Accept-Charset`
      </td>
      <td>
        **Optional** – If you do set this header, you must accept the `UTF-8`
        character set. If you don't you will receive a `406 Not Acceptable`
        response, because this data is only available in `UTF-8`.
