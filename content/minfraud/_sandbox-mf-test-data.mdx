<Alert type="info">
The Sandbox will return risk scores and risk data, but this data is not
accurate and should not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the minFraud
scoring engine, or for geolocation or IP intelligence. It is designed
for testing purposes only.
</Alert>

You may only submit approved test data to the Sandbox version of the minFraud
services. At this time, the only approved test transaction data are the three IP
addresses listed below. You can submit transactions to Sandbox minFraud services
with any of the following IP addresses as the
[`/device/ip_address`](/minfraud/api-documentation/requests?lang=en#schema--request--device__ip_address)
input. You should receive a minFraud response with risk scores and risk data.
The IP risk score output
([`/ip_address/risk`](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses?lang=en#schema--response--ip-address__risk))
will contain a response within the range defined below:

| Test IP Address Input | Test IP Risk Score Output Range |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `146.243.121.22`      | 15 - 99                         |
| `152.216.7.110`       | 5 - 14.99                       |
| `23.10.87.103`        | 0.01 - 4.99                     |

You should not submit real transaction data to the Sandbox version of the
minFraud services, but you can submit transactions with dummy data.
