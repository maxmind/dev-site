<ReleaseNote date="2015-03-27" title="Discontinuing /app/ws_ipaddr">
On April 28, we will deactivate the `/app/ws_ipaddr` endpoint. This endpoint
returns a list of IP addresses for use when making minFraud or GeoIP web
service requests to MaxMind servers.

If you use this endpoint, you need to take action in order to continue
accessing MaxMind services. Please switch and make requests using the
minfraud.maxmind.com hostname for minFraud webservice requests and
geoip.maxmind.com for GeoIP webservice requests.

If you use a minFraud client API we provided, please update to the latest API,
available on [the client APIs
page](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis). Our
newest API versions use hostnames instead of /app/ws_ipaddr.

If you use a third-party plugin that makes requests to MaxMind web services,
you may need to update it.
