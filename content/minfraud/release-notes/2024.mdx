<ReleaseNote date="2024-04-08" title="Email first seen can be used as a parameter for custom rules">

minFraud Insights and Factors customers can now use the
`/email/first_seen output` in minFraud custom rules.

The minFraud service retains a record of when an email address or email domain
was first seen on the minFraud Network. An email address that has been
conducting transactions for a long time across the minFraud Network may be more
trustworthy than a new email address created within the last 30 days.

You can select the email first seen output as a parameter in custom rules by
selecting minFraud outputs > Email first seen when defining a new condition for
a custom rule.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-04-08" title="Upcoming changes to our TLS certificates may impact customers with unusual server configuration">

Starting in May, Let's Encrypt will no longer use a cross-signed root
certificate, and the primary TLS certificate handling the `*.maxmind.com`
domains will be impacted by this change.

**Most customers will see no impact from this change.**

This change should only be of concern if the servers interacting with MaxMind
domains are running a very old or out of date operating system, or if you manage
your own local Certificate Authority store.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-03-13" title="API policies are now permanently enforced">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, our API policies are now being permanently enforced as of March
13, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests that are sent to the
  appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** Ensure that you are using the correct hostname for
your API requests, and that you are using HTTPS. Failure to do so will result in
web service or database download requests failing.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-25" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on February 7, 2024">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests on March 13, 2024. To help customers get ready for
this change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
February 7, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** To ensure that your MaxMind service is not
interrupted, please ensure ensure that you are using the correct hostname for
your API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to February 7, 2024.

If you have not made the requested changes before Wednesday, February 7, 2024,
you might experience a period where web service or database download requests
fail.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-22" title="minFraud no longer accepts event times more than one year in the past">

Starting tomorrow, January 23, 2024, minFraud will no longer accept
`/event/time` inputs with values more than one year in the past. Most customers
do not need to send the `/event/time` input and will not be impacted by this
change.
[Learn more about this input and how to use it to score historical transactions on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/5452006111003-Event-and-Account-Inputs#h_01G0Z3WBNAP5Y8WNRR156EJBBF)

If you send the `/event/time` inputs with values more than one year in the past,
minFraud will:

- replace the event time with the current time
- score the transaction and return a score
- return an `INPUT_INVALID` warning with its response
