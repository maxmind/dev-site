</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-12-01" title="Disposition Outputs for minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors">
The responses for minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors may now include a
[`disposition` object](/minfraud/api-documentation). This object contains
information about [custom
rules](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services/custom-rules)
that were applied to the request.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-11-17" title="New /credit_card/token Input">
We have added a new [`/credit_card/token` input](/minfraud/api-documentation)
to the minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors request bodies.
The token must uniquely identify the credit card and must be different from the
account number.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-10-10" title="New event types for minFraud requests">
We have added two new event types to the `/event/type` field for all minFraud
requests, `email_change` and `password_reset`.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-09-06" title="More proxy scores">
We will be returning more proxyScores between 0 and 1.8 and 1.8 and 3. Such
scores typically represent “medium” risk transactions which have some risk of
fraud but may be legitimate. The higher the proxyScore, the riskier the
transaction.

The proxyScore is a score from 0.00-4.00 indicating the likelihood that the
user's IP address is high risk.

This change has also been implemented for the IP Risk Score provided with
minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors. The IP Risk Score is a
score from 0.01 to 99 indicating the likelihood that the user's IP address is
high risk. We will return more positive IP Risk Scores between 0 and 45 and 45
and 75. Such scores typically represent “medium” risk transactions which have
some risk of fraud but may be legitimate. The higher the IP Risk Score, the
riskier the transaction.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-06-09" title="New Device Field">
`/device/confidence` and `/device/last_seen` have been added to the minFraud
Insights and minFraud Factors response. These fields are only available for
customers using our [Device Tracking Add-on](/minfraud/track-devices). Please
see our [API documentation](/minfraud/api-documentation)
for more information.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-06-06" title="Deprecated Fields and New Fields">
`credits_remaining` is deprecated in the minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and
minFraud Factors response. It will be removed before the final release. It has
been replaced with `queries_remaining`, which also returns the number of
queries available. An additional field, `funds_remaining`, containing the US
dollar value of the funds remaining will be added before the final release.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-02-18" title="Order Amount Now Used in Risk Score">
All minFraud services now include an updated machine learning algorithm that
takes order amount into consideration when calculating the risk score.

Merchants may want to update their rules if the rule is a combination of risk
score and order amount. For example, if a custom rule rejects transactions with
a high order amount and a risk score above 10, the merchant may want to adjust
the risk score to a higher number, as the high order amount itself may cause
the risk score to increase.

In general, orders $500 or above may have a higher risk score than before.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2016-01-29" title="New minFraud Insights Outputs">
The following outputs have been added to minFraud Insights:

- `/credit_card/brand` – The card brand, such as “Visa”, “Discover”, “American
Express”, etc.
- `/credit_card/type` – A string representing the card's type. The possible
values are `charge`, `credit`, or `debit`.
- `/device/id` – A UUID that MaxMind uses for the device associated with this
IP address. This is only available if you are using the [Device Tracking
Add-on](/minfraud/track-devices).
- `/email/is_free` – This field is `true` if MaxMind believes that this email
is hosted by a free email provider such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail.
- `/email/is_high_risk` – This field is `true` if MaxMind believes that this
email is likely to be used for fraud.

Also, for both minFraud Score and minFraud Insights, the `input` property in
the warning objects has been removed and replaced with an `input_pointer`
property. This new property is a JSON pointer to the value in the input object
causing the warning.

All of our client APIs have been updated to reflect these changes.

For more information on these outputs, please see [our minFraud Score and
minFraud Insights API documentation](/minfraud/api-documentation).
