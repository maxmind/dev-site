{{< release-note date="2026-01-28" title="Updates to autonomous_system_organization, ISP, and organization data">}}

On January 21, 2026, we released data with significant changes to
`autonomous_system_organization` and less significant changes to `isp` and
`organization` data.

Customers can expect to see in many cases improved, more readable versions of
`autonomous_system_organization` and, in some cases, small changes to `isp` and
`organization` data.

This change is reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoLite ASN database
- GeoLite City web service
- GeoIP ISP database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service
- minFraud Insights web service
- minFraud Factors web service

{{< release-note date="2026-01-06" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in additional countries">}}

and postal fields more often for cell networks in the following countries:

- Germany
- France
