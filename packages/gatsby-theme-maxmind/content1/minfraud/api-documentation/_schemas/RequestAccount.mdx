      'Max Length': 255,
    }}
  >
    A unique user ID associated with the end-user in your system. If your system
    allows the login name for the account to be changed, this should not be the
    login name for the account, but rather should be an internal ID that does
    not change. This is not your MaxMind account ID. No specific format is
    required.
  </Property>

    name="username_md5"
    tags={{
      'Max Length': 32,
    }}
  >
    An MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string of the username or login name associated
    with the account.
