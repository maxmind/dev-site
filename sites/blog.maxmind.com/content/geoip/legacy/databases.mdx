</Alert>

GeoIP Legacy is available in a variety of downloadable databases. These
databases use a custom binary format to maximize lookup speed. MaxMind also
offers CSV versions of the same data. This is useful if you would like to import
this data into a SQL RDBMS, for example.

## Binary Databases

The binary databases come in many flavors, each of which contains a specific
dataset. These are all offered as separate products with their own subscription.

At present, we offer the following databases:

- Country – maps the IP address to a country
- Region – maps the IP address to a specific state/province within a country
- City – maps the IP address to a specific city within a country. In the US, we
  are able to map many IP addresses to specific postal codes. This database also
  contains approximate latitude, longitude, and time zone data.
- Organization – maps the IP address to the organization which was assigned
  the IP address’s netblock.
- ISP – maps the IP address to the ISP which owns the IP, including wireless
  carriers.
- Netspeed – maps the IP address a particular network speed.
- Domain – maps the IP address to a domain (not a hostname).

_Latitude and longitude are not precise and should not be used to identify a
particular street address or household. To better represent a level of accuracy,
please include the accuracy_radius when displaying latitude and longitude and
make it clear that the coordinates refer to a larger geographical area instead
of a precise location._

### Download Limits

_MaxMind reserves the right to limit the number of downloads made within a
limited period of time._

## CSV Databases

<Alert type="warning">
New CSV Formats Available: This page is for our legacy CSV formats. For our
latest CSV formats, please see our [GeoIP2 Databases](/geoip/docs/databases).
</Alert>

The primary use case for these CSV files is to import them into a SQL database
or other data store.

This documentation details the contents of every CSV database. Some of our CSV
files are shipped as [zipped](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)>)
archives. Others are [gzipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).

In some cases, we offer a zip archive with multiple CSV files. The primary file
will contain IDs referring to rows in other files. Each of these files can be
imported directly into different database tables, and the referencing IDs will
function as foreign keys.

In the documentation below, all types are specified in a form that is useful for
defining a SQL database table, such as "varchar(40)" or "unsigned integer".

### Integer IPv4 Representation

Many of our databases include an integer representation of an IPv4 address. This
allows you to easily compare these addresses as numbers to determine if a
specific IP falls into a given range. This is especially useful with databases
that don't have native network address types. If your database _does_ have such
a type, like PostgreSQL, then we recommend using that type instead. If you are
using MySQL (which does _not_ have such a type), we recommend using the
[INET_ATON()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_inet-aton)
and
[INET_NTOA()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_inet-ntoa)
functions to perform conversions.

For cases where you cannot rely on your database to handle conversions, please
refer to this pseudo-code for calculating the integer value of an IPv4 address:

```bash
address = '174.36.207.186'

( o1, o2, o3, o4 ) = address.split('.')

integer_ip =   ( 16777216 * o1 )
             + (    65536 * o2 )
             + (      256 * o3 )
             +              o4
```

For the IP address `174.36.207.186` this produces the number 2,921,648,058.

Here is pseudo-code for turning an integer back into an IPv4 address:

```bash
integer_ip = 2921648058

o1 = int ( ipnum / 16777216 ) % 256;
o2 = int ( ipnum / 65536    ) % 256;
o3 = int ( ipnum / 256      ) % 256;
o4 = int ( ipnum            ) % 256;

address = ( o1, o2, o3, o4 ).join('.')
```

### SQL Queries

You can now incorporate the integer representation of `174.36.207.186` (as
calculated above) into an SQL query:

```sql
SELECT ip_country
FROM geoip
WHERE
2921648058 BETWEEN begin_ip_num AND end_ip_num
LIMIT 1
```

When using MySQL, you can have the database perform the address to number
conversion for you:

```sql
SELECT ip_country
FROM geoip
WHERE
INET_ATON('174.36.207.186') BETWEEN begin_ip_num AND end_ip_num
LIMIT 1
```

### CSV Database Fields

This is a list of available CSV downloads. Please see the section on
[field order](#field-order-and-database-format) for more information on the
order of available columns. All strings are returned in the
[ISO-8859-1 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1). This
encoding is also referred to as latin1.

particular street address or household._

### Field Order and Database Format

In order to parse a CSV database file successfully, you need to know the field
order for that database. We offer many different variations of our CSV
databases. In some cases, the same data may be available in three or four
different layouts.

Every CSV database includes column headers. Many of the databases also have a
copyright statement on their first line. You can determine the field order by
looking at the first few lines of the CSV file.

We also offer combined CSV format databases. For example, we offer a database
that combines the City, ISP, and Organization databases, as well as one that
combines the Country and ISP databases.

The [available downloads](https://www.maxmind.com/en/download_files) vary based
on the subscriptions you have paid for. To download a combined database, you
must purchase all the individual databases separately.
