## Additional Features

### Disposition API

We provide a [Dispositions API](/minfraud/working-with-transaction-dispositions)
for use with Disposition setting from the Transaction Details page. Use this API
to integrate with your order management system, payment processor, or other
internal system so that manual review decisions made from the Transaction
Details page are available within your own systems. For more information about
setting dispositions from the Transaction Details page, please refer to the
[minFraud Interactive reference guide](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-interactive-manual-review-guide/).

### Report Transactions

If you are using our minFraud transaction fraud detection service, we also
encourage you to use our [report transaction service](/minfraud/report-a-transaction).
By reporting transactions, you can help us significantly increase the amount of
fraud we can detect for you. We build custom machine learning models for each
customer based on reported transactions. We also manually review many reported
transactions to identify customizations and algorithmic improvements for each
customer reporting feedback.

### Device Tracking Add-on

You may optionally include the [Device Tracking JavaScript](/minfraud/track-devices)
on your site that helps us identify the device your customer is using to
determine whether it has been used in previous fraudulent transactions. The
device information is factored into the scores returned through the minFraud
service.

## Versioning

The minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors web services use
two part versions. Our current release is version 2.0. The major version number
will remain at 2 for the foreseeable future.

The minor version will only change if there are breaking changes in the web
service. A breaking change is one that breaks client code that follows the
documentation on this page. Breaking changes include changing the type of an
existing field, deleting a field entirely, or changing URIs.

All changes to the web services will be documented in the
[minFraud release notes](/minfraud/release-notes), whether or not the version
number is changed.

The following changes are not considered to be breaking changes and will not be
accompanied by a version number change:

* Increased validation of inputs that causes a warning to be returned when there
previously was not one.
* Adding a new request or response field, either at the top level of the
structure or in one particular object such as the billing or `credit_card`.
Client code should be written to allow for new fields to appear.
* Adding new values to enum fields such as processor.
* Adding or removing warning or error codes, and/or changing the body type for
an error. Client code should always check the `Content-Type` header for any
error response. Client code should also be prepared to handle any valid HTTP
4xx or 5xx status code.
* Adding a new service with a new path.
