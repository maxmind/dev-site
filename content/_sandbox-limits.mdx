The Sandbox environment imposes volume limits on API requests to prevent abuse.
The Sandbox should not be used to test the capacity of the production web
service in high volume situations.

If you are running into the request limit and need help, please
[reach out to our support team for assistance](https://share.hsforms.com/1wsOwiZ3LS1WlrB72grq0kAcntle).
