title: Geolocate an IP address using Web Services with the client-side JavaScript
---

Our GeoIP2 JavaScript client allows you to use GeoIP2 Precision services
client-side without doing any server-side integration on your end. While it is
convenient, there are some caveats with its usage. Some browser settings and
add-ons (such as ad blockers) may prevent the GeoIP2 JavaScript API from
successfully calling the web services. Additionally, there may be unexpected
usage spikes which you may want to monitor, due to moments of high traffic to
your website(s).

We highly recommend using a [server-side 
integration](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/web-services), as it is more secure and
more robust than a client-side integration.

## Implementation

Implementing the GeoIP2 JavaScript client involves registering your domain(s),
adding a JavaScript snippet to your web page, calling the desired API
method/service, and providing callbacks for all scenarios.

### 1. Register your domain(s)

All domains using the service must be registered. New users may [request a free
trial](https://www.maxmind.com/en/request-service-trial?service_geoip=1) or
[purchase web service
credit](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services) in order to
receive an account to register domains. Existing account holders are able to
[register domains 
directly](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/geoip/javascript/domains).

### 2. Add a JavaScript snippet to your page

In order to use this service, the following JavaScript must be included in your
page.

<Alert type="warning">
  **Do not download this JavaScript file and serve it from your server(s)!**

  The JavaScript file must be served from MaxMind servers, otherwise GeoIP2
  requests will fail.
</Alert>

```html
<script src="//geoip-js.com/js/apis/geoip2/v2.1/geoip2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### 3. Call an API method and provide callbacks

The JavaScript client provides 3 public methods:

| Option                                         | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `geoip2.country(onSuccess, onError, options)`  | Calls the "GeoIP2 Precision: Country" endpoint using the routable IP address associated with the machine on which it is running.  |
| `geoip2.city(onSuccess, onError, options)`     | Calls the "GeoIP2 Precision: City" endpoint using the routable IP address associated with the machine on which it is running.     |
| `geoip2.insights(onSuccess, onError, options)` | Calls the "GeoIP2 Precision: Insights" endpoint using the routable IP address associated with the machine on which it is running. |

All of the functions take the same 3 arguments:

* If successful, this function calls the `onSuccess` callback. The
  first parameter passed to the callback contains an object matching the output
  of one of MaxMind’s [Precision web service API
  responses](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses).

  In addition to the attributes listed in the web services API docs, the object
  also has a `most_specific_subdivision` property that provides access to the
  most specific subdivision object available. On browsers other than Internet
  Explorer 8, this is implemented as a non-enumerable property using
  `defineProperty`.

* If there is an error, the function calls the `onError` callback with
  the error object as a parameter.

* The optional `options` parameter is an object containing flags for the
  service. This parameter is reserved for future use. There are no options at
  this time.

### Example: Display the user's city name in a page

In this example, we are displaying the user's city name in a page.  We have 2
files: page.html and demo.js.

```html
<!-- page.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Which city am I in?</title>
    <script src="//geoip-js.com/js/apis/geoip2/v2.1/geoip2.js"></script>
    <!-- make sure this is after the geoip2.js file -->
    <script src="/demo.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
       Where am I?
    </p>

    <p>
      You are in <span id="city"></span>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js
// demo.js
var fillInPage = (function() {
  var updateCityText = function(geoipResponse) {

    /*
     * It's possible that we won't have any names for this city.
     * For language codes with a special character such as pt-BR,
     * replace names.en with names['pt-BR'].
    */
    var cityName = geoipResponse.city.names.en || 'your city';

    document.getElementById('city').innerHTML = cityName
  };

  var onSuccess = function(geoipResponse) {
    updateCityText(geoipResponse);
  };

  // If we get an error, we will display an error message
  var onError = function(error) {
    document.getElementById('city').innerHTML = 'an error!  Please try again..'
  };

  return function() {
    if (typeof geoip2 !== 'undefined') {
      geoip2.city(onSuccess, onError);
    } else {
      document.getElementById('city').innerHTML = 'a browser that blocks GeoIP2 requests'
    }
  };
}());

fillInPage();
```

### Successful responses

A successful response consists of a single JavaScript object. That object
contains a set of key/value pairs, where the keys are things like `country` and
`traits`, and the values are objects or arrays of objects.

While our REST API is documented as omitting missing keys, we add blank arrays
and objects in the JavaScript API. This makes it much simpler to work with the
response, as you will not need to check whether the data structure exists
before using it.

Wherever a missing property’s value could be an object or array, we will add an
empty object or array as needed. For example, if you call the `city()` method
and the response from the MaxMind server has no `city` key at all, it will end
up being filled in as:

```json
{
  "city": {
    "names": {}
  },
  "country": {...},
  "continent": {...},
  ...
}
```

If the response contains no `subdivisions` key, you will get this:

```json
{
  "city": {...},
  "country": {...},
  "continent": {...},
  "subdivisions": [ { "names": {} } ],
  ...
}
```

### Errors

All errors are passed in a JavaScript object as the first parameter to the
`onError` function. This object contains two keys, `code` and `error`. `code`
is a machine-readable error code that will not change. `error` is a
human-readable description of the error.

| Code                         | HTTP Status          | Description                                                                                             |

| HTTP_ERROR                   | (none)               | There was an error making the request to the GeoIP2 web service.                                        |

### Versioning

This document covers **version 2.1** of the GeoIP2 JavaScript API. Whenever
MaxMind releases a new version of the JavaScript API, we will use a new path,
so the old JavaScript files will always be accessible. For example, if we
released version 42.6 of the JavaScript API, its path would be
`/js/apis/geoip2/**v42.6**/geoip2.js`.

However, support will only be provided for the newest version of the JavaScript
API at any given time.

Please note that the JavaScript API and the web service REST API are versioned
separately. We will bump the JavaScript API version when we add new features or
need to break backwards compatibility with previous versions of the JavaScript
API.

Version 2.1 of the JavaScript API uses version 2.1 of the [GeoIP2 Precision web
services REST API](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services/).

### Browser support

MaxMind is committed to support all browser versions that are currently
supported by their respective creators. When the creator offers multiple
support levels, we only support the browser through its initial support phase.
For example, Microsoft has two support phases, Mainstream and Extended. We are
committed to supporting browsers through the end of the Mainstream support
phase. We reserve the right to end support at any time for any browser no
longer supported by its creator. In order to ensure your data is as safe and
secure as possible, we recommend using the encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) protocol.

Here is the list of browsers supported:

| Browser                     | Version(s)                                                  |

### Security

We require TLS 1.2 or greater for HTTPS requests to our servers to keep your
data secure.
