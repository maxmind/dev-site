GeoIP and GeoLite databases incorporate
[GeoNames geographical data](https://www.geonames.org/), which is made available
under the
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Monthly updates to GeoNames data are incorporated into our databases as we
refresh them. Above you will find a CSV report of these changes as they apply to
English place names for the month of October as they relate to the following
fields:

- `geoname_id`
- `country_name`
- `country_code`
- `city_name`
- `subdivision_1_iso_code`
- `subdivision_2_iso_code`

Note that the values for the `old_` and `new_` columns for a given field only
differ for the field defined in the `diff_in` column.

\* \* Due to some irregularities in the data, we elected not to update GeoNames data in August 2025 through September 2025. These issues have now been resolved and we are resuming regular GeoNames updates. As a result, this month's GeoNames update contains a larger number of differences than typical for a monthly update. These changes are expected.

{{< release-note date="2025-10-21" title="GeoIP Anonymous IP, GeoIP Anonymous Plus, and GeoIP IP Risk databases not released as scheduled yesterday">}}

The GeoIP database updates for Monday, October 20, 2025 for the following databases were not released as scheduled:

- GeoIP Anonymous IP
- GeoIP Anonymous Plus
- GeoIP IP Risk

These databases will return to their regular release schedule today, Tuesday October 21, 2025.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-10-14" title="GeoIP Anonymous Plus database size decrease">}}

The GeoIP Anonymous Plus database has significantly decreased in size due to an expected change to how we handle some low confidence networks.

A large number of lower confidence VPN networks have been removed from the GeoIP Anonymous Plus database. We have removed these networks in order to prevent false positives because we believe that the confidence was too low.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-09-22" title="A number of GeoIP database releases delayed">}}

The following GeoIP database releases will be delayed until Tuesday, September 23, 2025:

- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Country database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP ISP database

The GeoIP Anonymous IP, GeoIP Anonymous Plus, GeoIP IP Risk, and the GeoLite ASN databases will be released today as scheduled.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-08-28" title="No GeoNames monthly diff report for August 2025">}}

Due to irregularities in the latest GeoNames data, we will be maintaining the
location names and codes from July.

{{< release-note date="2025-08-13" title="Upcoming ISP name change for a subset of AT&T Wireless networks">}}

We will soon be distinguishing AT&T Internet Air connections from the broader
pool of AT&T Wireless networks.

Some networks previously labeled `AT&T Wireless` will have their ISP name
updated to `AT&T Internet Air`.

This change will go live on Tuesday, August 26, 2025 and will be reflected in
the following products and services:

- GeoIP ISP database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service

{{< release-note date="2025-07-29" title="Postal code formatting in a number of GeoIP databases">}}

Yesterday, July 28, 2025, we released a number of GeoIP databases containing a
number of poorly formatted or incorrect postal codes. The impacted databases
were:

- GeoIP City
- GeoIP Enterprise
- GeoLite City

For a brief period of time yesterday, GeoIP web service users may also have
experienced web service responses in which these poorly formatted or incorrect
postal codes were returned.

This issue has now been corrected. Please ensure you have downloaded the latest
database release if you do not have automated database downloads set up. Web
service customers do not need to take any action to receive the corrected data.

{{</ release-note >}}

The following GeoIP databases are now updated every weekday, Monday through
Friday:

- GeoIP City

We recommend automating GeoIP database updates so that you can be sure that you
always have the most accurate IP geolocation and IP intelligence data.

You can automate database updates with our GeoIP Update program or other
methods. You can also download databases directly through the account portal.

[Learn how to automate database updates in this knowledge base article.](https://support.maxmind.com/knowledge-base/articles/download-and-update-maxmind-databases#api-endpoints)

The GeoIP Anonymous and Anonymous Plus databases will continue to update daily.
The GeoIP Connection Type and GeoIP Domain Name databases and all GeoLite
databases (except GeoLite ASN) will continue to update only on Tuesdays and
Fridays.

{{< release-note date="2025-02-05" title="Update—Identifying Verizon 5g Home Internet" >}}

As announced in our
[previous release note](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/release-notes/2025/#identifying-verizon-5g-home-internet),
we are reclassifying a portion of Verizon Wireless networks in the United
States.

In addition to reclassifying the ISP name from `Verizon Wireless` to
`Verizon 5g Home Internet`, we will also be reclassifying the organization name
for consistency.

Starting on Friday, February 7, networks that have their ISP name set to
`Verizon 5g Home Internet` will also have their organization name set to
`Verizon 5g Home Internet`.

The following products and services will be affected:

- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP Insights and City Plus web services
- GeoIP ISP database
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-01-27" title="Identifying Verizon 5g Home Internet" >}}

Starting on Tuesday, February 4, we will be making changes to identify more
fixed wireless networks. We are starting with Verizon Wireless networks in the
United States.

Beginning with database releases on Tuesday, February 4, about 15% of traffic
previously identified with ISP name `Verizon Wireless` will be reclassified.

These networks will have their ISP name set to `Verizon 5g Home Internet` and
they will have their `user_type` set to `residential`. Their `connection_type`
will remain set to `Cellular`.

The following products and services will be affected:

- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP Insights and City Plus web services
- GeoIP ISP database
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services

{{< release-note date="2025-01-21" title="metro_code deprecation in GeoIP" >}}

The `metro_code` data in our GeoIP products and services is a
no-longer-maintained code. Because Google does not use or publish these codes
any longer, the `metro_code` field has now been deprecated in our GeoIP products
and services.

**What should I do?**

The field will not be removed from our databases and existing values will
continue to be populated, so you can continue using it if you find it valuable.
