We've created a [small utility
program](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip2-csv-converter) to allow you to
convert a GeoIP2 CSV file's representation of IP addresses to another format.
You can choose between start/end IP addresses, with the addresses represented
as strings or integers.

The program is available from our
[geoip2-csv-converter GitHub project releases tab.](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip2-csv-converter/releases)
