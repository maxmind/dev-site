{{< release-note date="2026-01-06" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in additional countries">}}

Effective tomorrow, Wednesday, January 7, 2026, we will be blanking out the city and postal fields more often for cell networks in the following countries: 

- Argentina
- Australia
- Germany
- France
- Japan
- Poland
- Spain
- Turkey

We will also be blanking out the subdivision, city, and postal fields more often in: 

- Finland
- Switzerland

This change is to reduce false positives when the end users of a network are dispersed all over the subdivision or country.

The update will be reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service
- minFraud Factors web service
- minFraud Insights web service
