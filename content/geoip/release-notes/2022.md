{{< release-note date="2022-12-19" title="December Holiday Database Release Schedule" >}}

Due to the December holidays, we will not be providing database updates for
certain databases this Friday, December 23. The following GeoIP2 and GeoLite2
databases will not have their regularly scheduled updates:

- GeoIP2 Country
- GeoIP2 City
- GeoIP2 Connection Type
- GeoIP2 ISP
- GeoIP2 Enterprise
- GeoLite2 Country
- GeoLite2 City

The GeoIP2 Anonymous IP database will continue to update as scheduled.

We will resume our regular update schedule beginning on Tuesday, December 27.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2022-12-19" title="Twice weekly updates for the GeoIP Connection Type database" >}}

We now update the GeoIP2 Connection Type databases twice weekly on Tuesdays and
Fridays (instead of weekly). We made this change so that data corrections and
updates can be deployed more quickly.

If you would like to take advantage of these more frequent updates, you will
have to update the schedule of your GeoIP2 database downloads.
[You can find documentation on updating your GeoIP2 databases on our developer’s site.](/geoip/updating-databases)

{{< release-note date="2022-09-26" title="Changes to Registered Country data" >}}
We have made some changes to how we determine the registered country associated

In some cases where we are no longer confident in the registered country for an
IP, it will be removed. In other cases, the value may be changed.

{{< release-note date="2022-06-01" title="GeoIP Legacy databases have been retired" >}}

In line with the
[announcement on our blog from 2020](https://blog.maxmind.com/retirement-of-geoip-legacy-downloadable-databases-in-may-2022/),
GeoIP Legacy databases have been retired.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2022-05-31" title="Data changes to GeoIP Legacy web services" >}}

In line with the
[announcement on our blog from 2020](https://blog.maxmind.com/data-changes-to-geoip-legacy-and-minfraud-legacy-web-services-in-may-2022/),
there will be several changes to the data in our GeoIP Legacy web services
beginning today. The following web services are affected:

- GeoIP Legacy City
- GeoIP Legacy City/ISP/Org
- GeoIP Legacy Insights (formerly known as Omni)

The following data changes have been made:

1. **Region codes:** The legacy web services historically returned region codes
   in the FIPS 10-4 standard (for all countries except for the US and Canada).
   Now, region codes worldwide will be returned in the ISO 3166-2 standard.
1. **Area codes:** Area code fields will now return blank.
1. **Country/Region/City names:** Country, region, and city names will now come
   from [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/).

For more information, read the
[full announcement on our blog from 2020](https://blog.maxmind.com/data-changes-to-geoip-legacy-and-minfraud-legacy-web-services-in-may-2022/).

Please note that
[associated changes to the minFraud Legacy web services are also being made](/minfraud/release-notes/2022/#data-changes-to-minfraud-legacy-web-services).

corrections.

Please update your integration to download updates according to this new
schedule.

For more information about database updates see the documentation our
[Developer Portal](/geoip/updating-databases) and
[Knowledge Base](https://support.maxmind.com/knowledge-base/articles/download-and-update-maxmind-databases).

have plans to diverge from GeoNames for IP addresses located in disputed
regions.

{{< release-note date="2022-02-09" title="Dialup values for connection_type and user_type deprecated" >}}
We have deprecated the dialup values for `connection_type` and `user_type` in
our GeoIP2 products and services:

- GeoIP2 Connection Type database
  - `connection_type` no longer has the possible value of `Dialup`
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
  - `connection_type` no longer has the possible value of `Dialup`
  - `user_type` no longer has the possible value of `dialup`
- GeoIP2 Insights web service
  - `user_type` no longer has the possible value of `dialup`

You can see a list of possible values for the `connection_type` data point in
our
[documentation for the GeoIP2 Connection Type database](/geoip/docs/databases/connection-type#blocks-files).

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2022-01-25" title="Mobile country and mobile network code data" >}}
We have added data containing the mobile country code and mobile network code to
several of our GeoIP2 product and services. Mobile country code and mobile
network code data uniquely identify mobile network operators (carriers). This
data can be used for carrier segmentation and targeting as well as general
analytics.
[Learn more about mobile country code data on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code)

This data will be included in the following GeoIP2 products and services:

- GeoIP2 ISP database
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
- GeoIP2 City Plus web service
- GeoIP2 Insights web service
- minFraud Insights web service
- minFraud Factors web service

### Database users

The `mobile_country_code` and `mobile_network_code` data will be included in all
new releases of the GeoIP2 ISP and Enterprise databases starting with today's
release.

#### CSV file users

The new data columns will be added to the following files:

- GeoIP2 ISP database
  - `GeoIP2-ISP-Blocks-IPv4.csv`
  - `GeoIP2-ISP-Blocks-IPv6.csv`
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
  - `GeoIP2-Enterprise-ISP.csv`

See our developer documentation for the GeoIP2
[ISP](/geoip/docs/databases/isp#blocks-files) and
[Enterprise](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise#isp-file) databases for more
information about the files. You can also download a sample CSV database
containing the new data columns for GeoIP2
[ISP](/geoip/docs/databases/isp#example-files) and
[Enterprise](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise#example-files) from our
developer's site.

#### MMDB file users

You may need to update your
[MMDB reader](/geoip/docs/databases#official-client-apis) to support lookups
containing the new output when it is released. You can find a sample MMDB file
with `mobile_country_code` and `mobile_network_code` on our
[GitHub page](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB/tree/main/test-data).

### Web service users

The new data will be included in the `/traits` object:

- [`/traits/mobile_country_code`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses#schema--response--traits__mobile_country_code)
- [`/traits/mobile_network_code`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses#schema--response--traits__mobile_network_code)

Our client APIs will be updated in the coming weeks to handle the new data. Make
sure to keep your client API up to date to start taking advantage of this data.

If you are interfacing directly with our REST API, you can begin receiving the
new data right away.

{{< release-note date="2022-01-10" title="GeoIP2 Precision is now GeoIP2 web service" >}}
We're dropping the "Precision" from our GeoIP2 web service names to make the
closest equivalent between our web services and databases clearer, and to make
it clear that IP geolocation is not precise enough to locate individuals or
street addresses.
[You can learn more about the accuracy and limitations to IP geolocation on our knowledge base.](https://support.maxmind.com/knowledge-base/articles/maxmind-geolocation-accuracy)

We are also renaming our city-level geolocation web service to be GeoIP2 City
Plus. We have added "Plus" to this web service to make it clearer that the
city-level geolocation web service also contains IP network data.
[You can see a list of all data points in the GeoIP2 City Plus web service on our main website.](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-api-web-services)

Nothing has changed about how to use our web services, and no changes are
required to your current integration.

Our GeoIP2 web services will be renamed as follows:

| Old Name                              | New Name (Click for the Product Page on our Main Website)                         |
