{{< release-note date="2025-06-16" title="EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE risk score reason added" >}}

We have added `EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE` as a new
[risk score reason](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/28488469041947-Risk-Score-Reasons).

The `EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE` risk reason will be returned as either
`EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE raised the overall risk score` or
`EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE lowered the overall risk score` to clearly indicate
the effect the reason has on the score.

Please [email product@maxmind.com](mailto:product@maxmind.com) if you have any
questions. {{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-02-24" title="Risk score reasons out of beta" >}}

Risk score reasons have been officially introduced and out of beta as of
February 19, 2025.

Available for all minFraud service tiers for individual transactions on the
Transaction Details page and also via API for the minFraud Factors service, risk
score reasons provide specific and understandable reasons for why a risk score
is high or low, helping to uncover risk patterns for individual transactions and
the overall transaction stream, both at a point in time and over time.

[Read our blog post](https://blog.maxmind.com/2025/02/how-to-enhance-your-fraud-strategy-with-minfraud-risk-score-reasons/)
to learn about the ‘why’ behind risk score reasons, and how you can use the data
they provide to enhance your fraud strategy.

{{< release-note date="2025-02-10" title="No longer returning A1 country code in minFraud legacy web services" >}}

For minFraud legacy web services, we will no longer return `A1` as a country
code.

This change is due to the removal of long-deprecated fields in our GeoIP
databases.
[See our GeoIP release note for more information](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/release-notes/2025/#removal-of-deprecated-fields).
