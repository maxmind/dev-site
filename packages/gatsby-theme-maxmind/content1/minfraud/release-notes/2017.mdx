<ReleaseNote date="2017-07-24" title="Dispositions API released">
We have added a Dispositions API for use with Disposition setting from the
Transaction Details page. Use this new API to integrate with your order
management system, payment processor, or other internal system so that manual
review decisions made in the MaxMind account portal are available within your
own systems. More information
[Here](/minfraud/working-with-transaction-dispositions).

<ReleaseNote date="2017-07-24" title="Mapping more mobile networks to regional level">
We will be mapping additional mobile (cellular) networks to a region
(subdivision) rather than city level. This change will only occur where the
confidence in the city data is low due to the mobile provider allocating IPs
over a wide area.
