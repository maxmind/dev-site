{{< release-note date="2025-02-24" title="Risk score reasons out of beta" >}}

Risk score reasons have been officially introduced and out of beta as of February 19, 2025. 

Available for all minFraud service tiers on the Transaction Details page and also via API for the minFraud Factors service, risk score reasons provide specific and understandable reasons for why a risk score is high or low, helping to uncover risk patterns for individual transactions and the overall transaction stream, both at a point in time and over time.

[Read our blog post](https://blog.maxmind.com/2025/02/how-to-enhance-your-fraud-strategy-with-minfraud-risk-score-reasons/) to learn about the ‘why’ behind risk score reasons, and how you can use the data they provide to enhance your fraud strategy.

{{< release-note date="2025-02-10" title="No longer returning A1 country code in minFraud legacy web services" >}}

For minFraud legacy web services, we will no longer return `A1` as a country code.

This change is due to the removal of long-deprecated fields in our GeoIP databases. [See our GeoIP release note for more information](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/release-notes/2025/#removal-of-deprecated-fields).
