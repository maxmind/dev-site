  For minFraud Score, this object only contains the `risk` for the IP address.
  For minFraud Insights and Factors, the object is the
  [GeoIP2 Insights response body](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#geoip2-insights-body-example)
  with four modifications:

1. `risk` has been added directly to the `ip_address` object
2. `local_time` has been added to the `location` sub-object
3. The `maxmind` object is not present. See below for descriptions.
4. minFraud Insights and Factors return the following anonymous IP outputs:

   - `is_anonymous`
   - `is_anonymous_vpn`
   - `is_hosting_provider`
   - `is_public_proxy`
   - `is_residential_proxy`
   - `is_tor_exit_node`

See the
[GeoIP2 Insights response body](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#geoip2-insights-body-example)
for more information.
