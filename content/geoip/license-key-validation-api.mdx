title: License Key Validation API
---

MaxMind provides a License Key Validation API, a valuable tool for developers
and organizations seeking to verify the validity of MaxMind license keys within
their systems. This API endpoint is designed to check the existence and format
of a license key, but it does not provide information about the license key's
access to MaxMind products or the account to which it is associated.

This API can be particularly useful when integrated with secret scanning tools
used for compliance purposes. By using our License Key Validation API in
conjunction, you can automate the process of finding and verifying MaxMind
license keys in your codebase. This can help prevent unauthorized use of your
keys and enhance the security of your applications.

## Request:

### Request URI

API calls should be made with HTTP POST request to:

`https://secret-scanning.maxmind.com/secrets/validate-license-key`

### Authorization/Security

There is no authorization needed for this endpoint. The request is made using
the license key itself.

### Request Body

The request body may include the following field:

| Key           | Value Type | Description                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `license_key` | string     | The `license_key` field should contain the license key that you want to validate. |

Here is an example of how to make the request using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://secret-scanning.maxmind.com/secrets/validate-license-key \
    -F license_key="your_license_key_here"

Please replace "your_license_key_here" with the actual license key you want to validate.
```

## Response

### Response Body (for successful requests)

When the license key is successfully validated, the server will return a status
of `204 No Content`. This means that the request was successful.

### Response Body (for unauthorized license keys)

When the license key is in the correct format but could not be validated in our
database, the server will return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "code": "AUTHORIZATION_INVALID",
  "error": "Your account ID or license key could not be authenticated."
}
```

The HTTP status will be `401 Unauthorized`.

### Response Body (for unsuccessful requests)

In the event of an error occuring such as a bad request that has a license key
with a bad format, the server will return a JSON object with the following
structure:

```json
{
  "code": "LICENSE_KEY_INVALID",
  "error": "'foo-bad-license-key' is not a valid license_key. when calling /secrets/validate-license-key"
}
```

The HTTP status will be a `400 Bad Request`.
