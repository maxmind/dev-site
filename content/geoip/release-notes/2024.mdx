<ReleaseNote date="2024-07-23" title="Off-schedule release for the GeoIP2 City and GeoIP2 Country databases">

On July 23, we will be issuing an off-schedule release of the following GeoIP
databases:

- GeoIP2 City database
- GeoIP2-Country database

We are reverting changes for a few IPv6 networks that are not currently in use
on the internet.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2024-07-10" title="Increase in the number of English place names with non-ASCII characters in GeoIP® products and services">

You will now see an increase in the number of English place names with accented
characters in GeoIP products and services. Previously, we were using the
ASCII-only version of the names.

Non-ASCII characters may contain diacritics, accents and other marks. For
example:

| Unicode     | ASCII       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `La Bassée` | `La Bassee` |

You may see English place names with non-ASCII characters in all products and
services that contain geolocation data, including:

- GeoIP Insights, City Plus, and Country web services
- GeoIP Enterprise, City, and Country databases
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services
- GeoLite City and Country web services
- GeoLite City and Country databases

<ReleaseNote date="2024-06-27" title="Upcoming changes to ISP names">

We are updating several ISP names in our data. We expect to release these
changes in new database updates and web service requests beginning Friday, July
12, 2024.

There are two kinds of changes to expect.

First, we will update several popular ISP names to match their current naming
and branding conventions:

| Current ISP name in MaxMind data    | Updated ISP name in MaxMind data |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Korea Telecom`                     | `KT`                             |
| `Telecom Italia`                    | `TIM`                            |
| `Telecom Italia Mobile`             | `TIM Mobile`                     |
| `SaudiNet`                          | `stc Saudi`                      |
| `Lg Powercomm`                      | `LG Uplus`                       |
| `Versatel Deutschland`              | `1&1 Versatel`                   |
| `Telefonica O2 UK`                  | `O2 UK`                          |
| `INDOSAT Internet Network Provider` | `Indosat`                        |
| `Telefonica del Peru`               | `Movistar Peru`                  |
| `TDC Danmark`                       | `TDC Net`                        |
| `T-mobile Polska`                   | `T-Mobile Polska`                |
| `Atlantic Broadband`                | `Breezeline`                     |
| `Vodafone New Zealand`              | `One NZ`                         |

Second, we will be updating the ISP name for a number of AT&T networks. About
1,000 (0.003%) AT&T networks in the United States will have an updated ISP name,
either `AT&T Internet` or `AT&T Wireless`.

Updated AT&T networks will have corresponding updates to their `connection_type`
value as well. For most networks, this will mean:

| Updated ISP name | Updated connection type |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AT&T Internet`  | `Cable/DSL`             |
| `AT&T Wireless`  | `Cellular`              |

Please note that some AT&T networks may not have the corresponding connection
type, because connection type values are dependent on additional signals.

These changes will be reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoIP Insights web service
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP ISP database
- GeoIP Connection Type database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

<ReleaseNote date="2024-04-08" title="Upcoming changes to our TLS certificates may impact customers with unusual server configuration">

Starting in May, Let's Encrypt will no longer use a cross-signed root
certificate, and the primary TLS certificate handling the `*.maxmind.com`
domains will be impacted by this change.

**Most customers will see no impact from this change.**

This change should only be of concern if the servers interacting with MaxMind
domains are running a very old or out of date operating system, or if you manage
your own local Certificate Authority store.

and they have now unmerged these subdivisions. We have used the ISO subdivision
codes for these subdivisions from before the 2020 change. The ISO subdivision
codes we will be using for these subdivisions are reflected in this diff report.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-03-13" title="API policies are now permanently enforced">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, our API policies are now being permanently enforced as of March
13, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests that are sent to the
  appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS. Failure to do so will result in web
service or database download requests failing.

You can view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads
on our Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)
- [GeoIP and GeoLite database downloads](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases)
- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

**Please note:** This enforcement also affects minFraud API requests. If you are
also a minFraud user,
[see our minFraud release note on this issue](/minfraud/release-notes/2024#api-policies-are-now-permanently-enforced).

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2024-02-13" title="No GeoNames Monthly Diff Report for February 2024">

Due to irregularities in the latest GeoNames data, we will be maintaining the
location names and codes from January.
[See the Monthly Diff Report for January 2024.](/geoip/release-notes/2024#geonames-monthly-diff-report-january-2024)

When the irregularities in the GeoNames data are resolved, we will update the
data and post a new Diff Report.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-25" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on February 7, 2024">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests March 13, 2024. To help customers get ready for this
change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
February 7, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to February 7, 2024.

If you have not made the requested changes before Wednesday, February 7, 2024,
you might experience a period where web service or database download requests
fail.

You can view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads
on our Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)
- [GeoIP and GeoLite database downloads](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases)
- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

**Please note:** This enforcement will also affect minFraud API requests. If you
are also a minFraud user,
[see our minFraud release note on this issue.](/minfraud/release-notes/2024#api-policies---temporary-enforcement-on-february-7-2024).

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-17" title="Presigned URLs for database downloads">

We will begin using R2 presigned URLs for all database downloads in order to
increase the security and reliability of our services. Database download links
and integration methods will not be changing.

**What do I need to do?**

MaxMind users who download databases should make sure that their HTTP client
follows redirects and there are no proxy or firewall settings that would block
requests to the host we are redirecting to. We will redirect requests using
HTTPS on the following hostname:

- `mm-prod-geoip-databases.a2649acb697e2c09b632799562c076f2.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`

**If you use a direct-download method (most CSV downloaders):**

The permalinks for downloading databases will not be changing. You will be
redirected from those permalinks to the R2 presigned URLs.

**If you use `geoipupdate` (most MMDB downloaders):**

We will be releasing a new major version that uses redirecting links. You can
test your server configuration by updating to this new major version in a
controlled environment before updating your version on production.

**If you download directly from the account portal:**

Check your firewall and browser security settings if you get errors when trying
to download.

**If you need more help:**

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-17" title="Anycast flag available for CSV format databases">

The Anycast data point is now available in all CVS format databases—and, as
[announced in a prior release note](/geoip/release-notes/2023#anycast-flag-available-for-geoip-web-services-and-databases),
it’s also available in all GeoIP web services and all MMDB format databases.

In most cases, the addition of a new field to CSV databases should be a
non-breaking change, but we recommend checking your integration to make sure
that it can accommodate the addition of new fields.

The field is present in the following GeoIP databases:

- GeoIP Country database
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

**GeoLite databases**

The Anycast field has also been added to the CSV version of GeoLite geolocation
databases, but the new field is intentionally blank. This allows the GeoIP
databases to continue to be drop-in replacements for GeoLite databases, so that
it's easy to upgrade.

The field is present in the following GeoLite databases:

- GeoLite Country database
- GeoLite City database

**Confirming your integration allows for new data points**

The new field has been added to the Blocks CSV files:
`{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv4.csv` and
`{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv6.csv`

The new field name, `is_anycast`, has been added to the right of existing fields
and the cell will either contain 1 (if the network is an Anycast network) or be
blank (if it is not). The overwhelming majority of networks are not Anycast, and
so this field will be blank in most cases.

If you're not sure whether you're using the MMDB format, the CSV format, or
both, you can
[learn how to check your account's database download history to determine whether you are downloading CSV files](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407114914843).

Please use the following example CSV files to test your integration:

- [GeoIP Enterprise example files](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise/#csv-example-files)
- [GeoIP City and Country example files](/geoip/docs/databases/city-and-country/#csv-example-files)

We have also updated our tutorials on importing GeoIP databases. Please see
relevant links below:

- [Importing to PostgreSQL](/geoip/importing-databases/postgresql)
- [Importing to MySQL](/geoip/importing-databases/mysql)
