<ReleaseNote date="2023-08-17" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on October 17, 2023">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests in March 2024. To help customers get ready for this
change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
October 17, 2023.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to October 17, 2023. You can
view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads on our
Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)
- [GeoIP and GeoLite database downloads](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases)
- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

<ReleaseNote date="2023-08-03" title="Resolving more networks to borough of Queens, New York">

Starting with tomorrow's release we will begin resolving IPs that currently
return the neighborhood of Flushing (Queens, NY) to the corresponding borough of
Queens in the city name field.

For more granular place identification (such as neighborhood), we recommend
using the postal code where provided.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-08-01" title="New Satellite connection type">

On Tuesday August 29, 2023 we will be adding a new connection type value,
`Satellite`, which will identify satellite internet providers such as Starlink,
Viasat, and Hughes. Satellite connections typically have higher latency than
cable/DSL connections.

The `Satellite` connection type value will appear in the following databases:

- GeoIP Connection Type database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

Users of the following client APIs will need to update their API to the latest
version to avoid breaking changes with the new value:

- [Update Java API to version 4.1.0](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g:com.maxmind.geoip2%20%20a:geoip2&smo=true)
- [Update Node API to version 4.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maxmind/geoip2-node)

<ReleaseNote date="2023-06-14" title="Twice weekly updates for the GeoIP Domain Name database">

Beginning this Friday, June 16, we will update the GeoIP Domain Name databases
twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays (instead of monthly). We made this change
so that data corrections and updates can be deployed more quickly.

If you would like to take advantage of these more frequent updates, you will
have to update the schedule of your GeoIP database downloads.
[You can find documentation on updating your GeoIP databases on our developerâ€™s site.](/geoip/updating-databases)

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-06-12" title="Correction regarding London boroughs in our geolocation data">

On June 6,
[we announced that more networks would be mapped to London boroughs](#more-networks-mapped-to-london-boroughs)
beginning on Friday, June 9.

This change has been delayed. It should be present in our products and services
beginning on Friday, June 16.

In addition, for networks in the greater London area we will be returning the
name of the town for city-level name data instead of the borough. The borough
will be populated in the second level subdivision.

For example, a network that maps to the Walthamstow town will return Walthamstow
for the city_name, and Walthamstow Forest for the second level subdivision.

<ReleaseNote date="2023-06-12" title="Delayed update for GeoIP Anonymous IP database">

We are aware of an issue that caused a delay to the GeoIP Anonymous IP database
release. The database was not released on Friday, June 9 through Sunday,
June 11.

The issue has been corrected, and the database will be released today, Monday,
June 12, and going forward, as normal.

<ReleaseNote date="2023-03-16" title="Changes to MaxMind License Keys">

We are making changes to the format of our license keys:

- New license keys will be longer, with a six character prefix.
- Beginning on March 27, 2023, we will no longer be issuing unhashed license
  keys for use with legacy versions of
  [our GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases) (any version prior to
  v3.1.1).

**For customers using our REST API, Client APIs or version 3.1.1 and higher of
[our GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases):**

No action is required. Existing license keys will still be valid and will
continue to function normally.

New license keys will have the following changes:

- The character set is changing from `[a-zA-Z0-9]` to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
- The length of the license key will now be 40 characters.
- License keys will have a `_mmk` suffix.

Please note that the length of license keys may be increased in the future.

**Customers using legacy versions of our GeoIP Update program:**

Legacy versions of `geoipupdate` use less secure unhashed license keys.
Beginning on March 27, 2023 we will no longer be issuing new unhashed license
keys. Your existing license keys can continue to be used, but you will no longer
be able to generate new unhashed license keys.

New license keys only work with geoipupdate version 3.1.1 or greater. We
encourage you to update to the latest version at your earliest convenience.
