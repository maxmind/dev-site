<ReleaseNote date="2023-03-29" title="Improvements to minFraud Interactive">

We have made a number of improvements to the user interface for minFraud
Interactive, the interface used to view minFraud transactions through your
account portal.

The functionality of the interface is not changed, but some of the features now
appear in a different place on the screen, and the transaction information is
now displayed differently.

[Learn how to navigate the new interface on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408754902171-View-the-Log-of-my-minFraud-Transactions)

<ReleaseNote date="2023-03-21" title="Velocity Checking on User ID">

We have enabled velocity tracking on the `account/user_id` input for all
minFraud customers.

If you send a user ID associated with your transactions, minFraud will now
factor the velocity of the user's transactions into the risk score.

The `account/user_id` input allows you to pass a unique identifier for each of
your users so that the minFraud service can group transactions by user in order
to identify fraud signals attached to specific users.

<ReleaseNote date="2023-03-16" title="New License Key Format">

We have updated the format of our license keys. New license keys will be longer,
with a six character prefix.

The new license keys can be used in all current versions of our Client APIs and
in version 3.1.1 and higher of
[our GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases).

No action is required for minFraud users. Existing license keys will still be
valid and will continue to function normally.

New license keys will have the following changes:

- The character set is changing from `[a-zA-Z0-9]` to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
- The length of the license key will now be 40 characters.
- License keys will have a `_mmk` suffix.

Please note that the length of license keys may be increased in the future.
