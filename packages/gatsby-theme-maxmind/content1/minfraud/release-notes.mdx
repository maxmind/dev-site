<ReleaseNote date="2021-09-23" title="Update to minimum accuracy_radius value">
Effective October 4, 2021, the minimum accuracy radius value will be 5km across
our city/postal-level geolocation products and services. Previously, the minimum
accuracy radius value was 1km. This change applies to the following products and
services:

- GeoIP2 City database
- GeoLite2 City database
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
- GeoIP2 Precision City web service
- GeoIP2 Precision Insights web service
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services

We are making this change in order to ensure it is clear that IP geolocation
should not be used to identify a particular street address or household.

<ReleaseNote date="2021-09-08" title="Data Updates for Apple iCloud Private Relay">
We have updated our data in a number of ways in preparation for the rollout of
[iCloud Private Relay](https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay/).
We have worked with Apple to ensure that our data accurately reflects how
Private Relay works and delivers the best possible user experience for your
users.

- Geolocation data across our products and services now incorporate the IP
geolocation feeds published by Apple, which provides coarse city or region
geolocation mappings for iCloud Private Relay IPs.
- We identify iCloud Private Relay IPs in our ISP dataset (present in our
[minFraud Insights and
Factors](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services) web services)
by tagging ranges as `iCloud Private Relay`.

Apple has shared the following assurances built into Private Relay:

- Geolocation information for clients is validated by the relay servers using
signed tokens, and visible to origins through the IP addresses selected by relay
servers.
   - A user is not able to arbitrarily select their geolocation to evade
   geolocation controls.
- Access to relay servers is rate-limited using device attestation to reduce
fraud.
- All traffic is secured using TLS 1.3.

You do not need to take any action to receive this data. It will be returned in
the [`/traits/isp`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits__isp)
and [`/traits/organization`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits__organization)
outputs.

For more information about Private Relay along with helpful technical
information, visit [Prepare Your Network or Web Server for Private Relay](https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay/)
on Apple’s developer website.

We will continue to monitor these IPs and make any adjustments that are needed
in the future.

<ReleaseNote date="2021-09-03" title="New minFraud features: passing 3-D Secure outcome, custom rule label in minFraud response, “test” disposition for custom rules">
We have released a couple of new features for the [minFraud Score, Insights, and
Factors service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services).

* A new input, [`/credit_card/was_3d_secure_successful`](/minfraud/api-documentation/requests#schema--request--credit-card__was_3d_secure_successful),
which allows you to send us whether the outcome of
[3-D Secure verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) was
successful. This can help us improve your risk scoring.
* A new output, [`/disposition/rule_label`](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses#schema--response--disposition__rule_label),
which returns the label of the custom rule that affected a transaction.
* A new value for the [`/disposition/action` output](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses#schema--response--disposition__action),
“test”. This additional disposition action can be used to separate transactions
for rules which you are interested in actively testing without affecting your
existing workflows.

For more information, see our [blog post](https://blog.maxmind.com/2021/09/03/new-minfraud-features-passing-3-d-secure-outcome-custom-rule-label-in-minfraud-response-test-disposition-for-custom-rules/).

Our [client APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis)
have been updated to support these outputs so may need to refresh yours if you
are not interfacing directly with our REST API.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-05-19" title="Updated warning codes in minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors">
We updated warning codes for [minFraud Score, Insights and Factors](/minfraud)
responses in the [/warnings/
object](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--warnings).

* We added `BILLING_REGION_NOT_FOUND` and `SHIPPING_REGION_NOT_FOUND` codes
* We updated the warning explanations for certain warning codes to include that
distance calculations (outlined below) may be impacted when certain location
information is missing or cannot be found
    - `/shipping_address/distance_to_ip_location`
    - `/shipping_address/distance_to_billing_address`
    - `/billing_address/distance_to_ip_location`

See our developer documentation for the [updated codes and
warnings](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--warnings).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-05-13" title="Updates to minFraud Alerts">
We recently made some updates to minFraud alerts, which notifies minFraud users
about previously low-risk transactions that are now high-risk due to updated
information. Learn more [on our
blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2021/05/12/what-are-minfraud-alerts-and-what-do-i-do-with-them/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-02-22" title="Normalize Emails Before Hashing for Improved minFraud Scoring">
The client APIs for minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors now normalize emails
prior to hashing them for improved risk scoring. Email normalization ensures
that minor, inconsequential differences in the email input (i.e.,
`jadoeisonline@yahoo.com` and `jadoeisonline-12345@yahoo.com`) do not result in
minFraud treating these as different email addresses.

Our [client
APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) for
minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors have been updated to support email
normalization so you may need to refresh yours in order to get automatic email
normalization. If you interface directly with our REST API or use minFraud
Legacy, we recommend that you normalize email addresses prior to hashing.
Please see our developer’s site for [guidance on how to normalize
emails](/minfraud/normalizing-email-addresses-for-minfraud).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-02-03" title="New output IP risk reasons">
The `ip_address/risk_reasons` output is now available. [minFraud
Insights](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services) and [minFraud
Factors](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services/minfraud-factors)
customers can now see reason codes associated with the IP risk score for high
risk IP addresses. When the IP risk score is high, the field may be populated
with one or more of the following reason codes:

* `ANONYMOUS_IP` – The IP address belongs to an anonymous network. See
`/ip_address/traits` for more information.
* `HIGH_RISK_DEVICE` – A high risk device was seen on this IP address in your
past transactions.
* `HIGH_RISK_EMAIL` – A high risk email address was seen on this IP address in
your past transactions.
* `BILLING_POSTAL_VELOCITY` – Many different billing postal codes have been
seen on this IP address in your past transactions.
* `EMAIL_VELOCITY` – Many different email addresses have been seen on this IP
address in your past transactions.
* `ISSUER_ID_NUMBER_VELOCITY` – Many different issuer ID numbers have been seen
on this IP address in your past transactions.
* `MINFRAUD_NETWORK_ACTIVITY` – Suspicious activity has been seen on this IP
address across minFraud customers.

If the IP risk score is low, the `risk_reasons` field will be blank. Our
[client APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis)
have been updated to support this output so you may need to refresh yours in
order to see the new output if you are not interfacing directly with our REST
API.

<ReleaseNote date="2021-01-22" title="Change to Vodafone Germany ISP name">
On Monday, January 25 we will be updating MaxMind products and services with
ISP data to consolidate naming conventions for Vodafone Germany. We will now
return either `Vodafone Germany Cable`, `Vodafone Germany DSL`, `Vodafone
Germany Business`, or `Vodafone Germany`. Previous values were `Vodafone GmbH`,
`Vodafone Germany`, and `Vodafone DSL`. We are updating these values to more
accurately reflect the type of connection that the IP address is associated
with.
