{{< release-note date="2024-10-09" title="Upcoming improvements to user count data" >}}

On Tuesday, October 22, 2024, we will release an improvement to our user count
data to better detect IPs with multiple end users.

Many IP addresses with multiple end users that previously had a user count value
of 0 or 1 will now have a value of 2.

If you have applications of the data that rely on user count values with a
threshold of 0, 1, or 2, you may want to increase the thresholds by 1. For
example, if you currently consider user count values of greater than 1 to be
high volume, you may wish to consider user count values of greater than 2 to be
high volume when this update goes live.

The following services will be impacted:

- GeoIP Insights web service

{{< release-note date="2024-08-16" title="Improved confidence factor scores" >}}

On September 3, 2024, we will be releasing a significant improvement to our
geolocation confidence factors. This improvement will impact around 30% of the
networks in the GeoIP Insights web service and the GeoIP Enterprise database.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2024-08-13" title="Increase in geolocation database sizes" >}}

Our IP geolocation databases released on Tuesday, August 13, 2024 will be
significantly larger than our last release.

This increase in size is due to a new data source providing improved geolocation
resolution for a large number of networks in Germany and Finland.

The following databases will be affected:

- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoLite City database

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2024-08-12" title="Off-schedule release for the GeoIP City, GeoIP Country, and GeoIP Enterprise databases" >}}

Today, we are issuing an off-schedule release of the following GeoIP databases:

We are correcting country-level information for a small number of networks
associated with Microsoft Teams.

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2024-08-12" title="Updated postal codes for some cities in Portugal" >}}

We are updating postal code data for the following major cities in Portugal:

- `Amadora`
- `Portoand`
- `Vila Nova De Gaia`

When an IP address is geolocated to any of these cities, the last three digits
of the postal code will be set to `001`. This change will be implemented over
time, with some networks being updated starting on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, and
more networks to follow.

The last three digits of postal codes are used in larger cities to provide
geolocation information that is more specific than our underlying data allows
for, so these digits will be set to `001`. In more rural areas, the last three
digits will be maintained.

The changes will be reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Insights web service
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- minFraud Insights web service
- minFraud Factors web service
- GeoLite City database
- GeoLite City web service

Second, we will be updating the ISP name for a number of AT&T networks. About
1,000 (0.003%) AT&T networks in the United States will have an updated ISP name,
either `AT&T Internet` or `AT&T Wireless`.

Updated AT&T networks will have corresponding updates to their `connection_type`
value as well. For most networks, this will mean:

| Updated ISP name | Updated connection type |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AT&T Internet`  | `Cable/DSL`             |
| `AT&T Wireless`  | `Cellular`              |

Please note that some AT&T networks may not have the corresponding connection
type, because connection type values are dependent on additional signals.

These changes will be reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoIP Insights web service
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP ISP database
- GeoIP Connection Type database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

Starting in May, Let's Encrypt will no longer use a cross-signed root
certificate, and the primary TLS certificate handling the `*.maxmind.com`
domains will be impacted by this change.

**Most customers will see no impact from this change.**

This change should only be of concern if the servers interacting with MaxMind
domains are running a very old or out of date operating system, or if you manage
your own local Certificate Authority store.

{{< release-note date="2024-03-13" title="API policies are now permanently enforced" >}}

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, our API policies are now being permanently enforced as of March
13, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests that are sent to the
  appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS. Failure to do so will result in web
service or database download requests failing.

You can view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads
on our Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)
- [GeoIP and GeoLite database downloads](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases)
- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

**Please note:** This enforcement also affects minFraud API requests. If you are
also a minFraud user,
[see our minFraud release note on this issue](/minfraud/release-notes/2024#api-policies-are-now-permanently-enforced).

location names and codes from January.
[See the monthly diff report for January 2024.](/geoip/release-notes/2024#geonames-monthly-diff-report-january-2024)

When the irregularities in the GeoNames data are resolved, we will update the
data and post a new diff report.

{{< release-note date="2024-01-25" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on February 7, 2024" >}}

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests March 13, 2024. To help customers get ready for this
change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
February 7, 2024

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to February 7, 2024.

If you have not made the requested changes before Wednesday, February 7, 2024,
you might experience a period where web service or database download requests
fail.

You can view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads
on our Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)

- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

**Please note:** This enforcement will also affect minFraud API requests. If you
are also a minFraud user,
[see our minFraud release note on this issue.](/minfraud/release-notes/2024#api-policies---temporary-enforcement-on-february-7-2024).

{{< release-note date="2024-01-17" title="Presigned URLs for database downloads" >}}

We will begin using R2 presigned URLs for all database downloads in order to
increase the security and reliability of our services. Database download links
and integration methods will not be changing.

**What do I need to do?**

MaxMind users who download databases should make sure that their HTTP client
follows redirects and there are no proxy or firewall settings that would block
requests to the host we are redirecting to. We will redirect requests using
HTTPS on the following hostname:

- `mm-prod-geoip-databases.a2649acb697e2c09b632799562c076f2.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`

**If you use a direct-download method (most CSV downloaders):**

The permalinks for downloading databases will not be changing. You will be
redirected from those permalinks to the R2 presigned URLs.

**If you use `geoipupdate` (most MMDB downloaders):**

We will be releasing a new major version that uses redirecting links. You can
test your server configuration by updating to this new major version in a
controlled environment before updating your version on production.

**If you download directly from the account portal:**

Check your firewall and browser security settings if you get errors when trying
to download.

**If you need more help:**

{{< release-note date="2024-01-17" title="Anycast flag available for CSV format databases" >}}

The Anycast data point is now available in all CVS format databases—and, as
[announced in a prior release note](/geoip/release-notes/2023#anycast-flag-available-for-geoip-web-services-and-databases),
it’s also available in all GeoIP web services and all MMDB format databases.

In most cases, the addition of a new field to CSV databases should be a
non-breaking change, but we recommend checking your integration to make sure
that it can accommodate the addition of new fields.

The field is present in the following GeoIP databases:

- GeoIP Country database
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

**GeoLite databases**

The Anycast field has also been added to the CSV version of GeoLite geolocation
databases, but the new field is intentionally blank. This allows the GeoIP
databases to continue to be drop-in replacements for GeoLite databases, so that
it's easy to upgrade.

The field is present in the following GeoLite databases:

- GeoLite Country database
- GeoLite City database

**Confirming your integration allows for new data points**

The new field has been added to the Blocks CSV files:
`{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv4.csv` and
`{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv6.csv`

The new field name, `is_anycast`, has been added to the right of existing fields
and the cell will either contain 1 (if the network is an Anycast network) or be
blank (if it is not). The overwhelming majority of networks are not Anycast, and
so this field will be blank in most cases.

If you're not sure whether you're using the MMDB format, the CSV format, or
both, you can
[learn how to check your account's database download history to determine whether you are downloading CSV files](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407114914843).

Please use the following example CSV files to test your integration:

- [GeoIP Enterprise example files](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise/#csv-example-files)
- [GeoIP City and Country example files](/geoip/docs/databases/city-and-country/#csv-example-files)

We have also updated our tutorials on importing GeoIP databases. Please see
relevant links below:
