## Headers

The `Content-Type` for a successful response varies based on the service as
outlined below:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Content-Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Score
      </td>
      <td>
        `application/vnd.maxmind.com-minfraud-score+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Insights
      </td>
      <td>
        `application/vnd.maxmind.com-minfraud-insights+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Factors
      </td>
      <td>
        `application/vnd.maxmind.com-minfraud-factors+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Errors may be returned with the `Content-Type` set to
`application/vnd.maxmind.com-error+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`.
If this is the case, then the body of the response contains a JSON document
with two keys, code and error. See the
[Errors](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#errors) section for more
details.

A `Content-Length` header will be provided.

## Bodies

Each service returns data as a JSON document. The document that is returned
always consists of an object (aka map or hash). Below are full examples of the
JSON body document for the minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud
Factors services, and a full example of the JSON body document for an error.
For detailed explanations of each property within the response body, please
refer to the [object reference](#object-reference) section below.

### Score Body

<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(responseJson.score, null, 2)}
</Example>

### Insights Body
<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(responseJson.insights, null, 2)}
</Example>

### Factors Body
<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(responseJson.factors, null, 2)}
</Example>

### Error Body
<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(responseJson.error, null, 2)}
</Example>

## Errors

When the server returns an error (`4xx` or `5xx`), the response may include a
JSON document in the body. This document is a single object with the keys `code`
and `error`. The `code` field is a static error code for machine use. The value
of any given code will never change, though codes can be added or removed. The
`error` field is a human-readable description of the error and may change at any
time.

Not all errors include a JSON body. An error in content negotiation will not
include a body, nor will many `5xx` errors, which typically happen outside of
our web service request handling code. You should check the `Content-Type` type
of an error response before attempting to decode the body as JSON.

In addition to the errors documented below, client code should also be prepared
to handle any valid HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` status code.

        parse a request body of that type.

## Object Reference

Each schema definition contains a description of an object, along with a list of
properties that belong to the object. The following information is listed for
each object property:

  {/* <!-- lint disable list-item-bullet-indent --> */}
  * name
  * type (`array<type>`, `boolean`, `number`, `integer`, `object`, `string`)
  * description
  * example
  * formatting
  * constraints
  * supported services (`Score`, `Factors`, `Insights`)
  {/* <!-- lint enable list-item-bullet-indent --> */}

Additionally, for `object` properties, a link is provided to view a schema
definition that further describes that specific object.

<Alert type="info">
* Keys with undefined or empty values will not be included in the returned
  in the response object.

* The data returned in the document will be in UTF-8 encoding.

* A given key and value may be omitted from the response entirely if there
  is no relevant information to include. For example, if you do not pass any
  information about the credit card in your request, then the response will
  not contain a `credit_card` key or value.
