title: Updating GeoIP and GeoLite Databases
---

There are two methods for automatically updating GeoIP2 and GeoIP Legacy binary
databases:

1. Using MaxMind's [GeoIP Update
program](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate/releases).
2. Directly downloading the database.

For clients using our binary database format, we highly recommend using GeoIP
Update, but the direct download method is available if necessary. Clients using
the CSV-format databases must use the direct download method.

## Using GeoIP Update

MaxMind provides the GeoIP Update program, which performs automatic updates for
both GeoIP2, GeoIP Legacy, and GeoLite2 binary databases.

### 1. Install GeoIP Update

Install GeoIP Update. The latest release may be downloaded from [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate/releases). See
[the installation instructions](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate) for more
information. GeoIP Update can also be installed via our [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/maxmindinc/geoipupdate).

If you are using an older version of GeoIP Update, you may need to upgrade to
GeoIP Update 4.x or later version. The 4.x and later versions meet our
requirement for using TLS 1.2 or greater for all requests to our servers to
keep your data secure.

Please see our [upgrade guide](/geoip/upgrading-geoip-update) for more
information on upgrading from an older version of GeoIP Update.

### 2. Obtain GeoIP.conf with Account Information

Log in to your account portal to download a partially [pre-filled configuration
file](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key/GeoIP.conf) and
save it in your configuration directory (e.g., `/usr/local/etc/`) as
`GeoIP.conf`. You will need to replace the `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE` placeholder
with an active license key associated with your MaxMind account. You can see
your license key information on [your account License Keys
page](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).

<Alert type="warning">
  You may also write this file by hand using the template below
  (**not  recommended**).

  Note that for `geoipupdate` versions less than 2.5.0, use `UserId` instead
  of `AccountID` and `ProductIds` instead of `EditionIDs`.
</Alert>

```bash
# GeoIP.conf file - used by geoipupdate program to update databases
# from http://www.maxmind.com
AccountID YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE
LicenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE
EditionIDs YOUR_EDITION_IDS_HERE
```

### 3. Run GeoIP Update

Run `geoipupdate`. To fully automate this process on Linux or Unix, use a
crontab file like:

<GeoIPCrontab />

This crontab file would run twice a week, and it would email you the results.

If you are running a firewall, `geoipupdate` requires that the DNS and HTTPS
(443) ports be open.

### Troubleshooting

If you receive an error when running GeoIP Update, you can use the verbose
option by adding the `-v` flag. This will print out each step taken as it runs.
The information provided can often help to clarify issues. Additional
instructions for GeoIP Update can be viewed when running `man geoipupdate` on
the command line.

Please note that GeoIP Update requires current access to database updates to
run properly. If your subscription needs to be renewed, updates can be
purchased while logged into [your Account Summary
page](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/people/current).

Updating to the [latest release of GeoIP
Update](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate/releases) may be required to
resolve some errors. If you are not currently using version 4 or higher of GeoIP
Update and would like to learn about upgrading to the current version of the
program, read our [guide on how to upgrade to GeoIP Update version
4.x](/geoip/upgrading-geoip-update).

## Directly downloading databases

This is only recommended for systems unable to use GeoIP Update or for clients
using the CSV-format databases.

In order to download the databases from a script or program, please use the
permalinks found on the [GeoIP download
page](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/geoip/downloads).

1. In the “Download Links” column, click “Get Permalink(s)” for the desired
database.
2. Copy the permalink(s) provided in the modal window.
3. Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with [your license
key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).
4. If you are using `wget` or `curl` from a shell script, please be sure to
quote the URL.

This download will return a compressed file in gzip (for binary) or zip (for
CSV) format, which can be uncompressed using a program like
[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [gzip](https://www.gzip.org/).

### Checking for the Latest Release Date

You can check the date of a given database’s latest release by issuing a HEAD
request for that database’s download permalink URL. The download permalink can
be found in the [Download
Databases](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/geoip/downloads) section
of your account portal.

For example, using the permalink for the GeoIP2 City CSV database, you can
issue a command like the following:

```cli
curl -I 'https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=GeoIP2-City-CSV&license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&suffix=zip'
```

Where `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` is a placeholder for your account’s actual
[license key](https://support.maxmind.com/account-faq/account-related/where-do-i-find-my-license-key/).

In the response, you can check the `last-modified` header for the file’s build
date, or you can check the `content-disposition` header for the date that would
appear in the file name. These checks can be incorporated into your own script
or program, according to your needs.

This method only issues a HEAD request, rather than a download request, so
running this check won’t count against your [daily database download
limit](https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-faq/geoip2-and-geoip-legacy-databases/is-there-a-limit-to-how-often-i-can-download-a-database-from-my-maxmind-account/).

## Third-party tools

<Alert type="warning">
  **_Use at your own risk._** MaxMind does not offer support for these tools
  and has not reviewed the code.
</Alert>

The following tools have been developed by the community of GeoIP users. MaxMind
does not offer support for these integrations, or maintain them. See [our guide
on developing for the community](/contribute) if you have questions about
creating or sharing your own unofficial tools.

* [Geoip2 Update](https://github.com/tronovav/geoip2-update) - A PHP tool for
  updating MaxMind GeoLite2 and GeoIP2 databases from your script or via
  Composer.

## Changes to file size between updates

It is expected for database files to increase or decrease in size from time to
time between releases. As we incorporate data corrections and new data sources,
we will add entries to our databases. Sometimes IP ranges are taken out of use
and removed. You should develop your integration with the expectation that
changes to the size of our databases will occur.

When we anticipate significant changes to the size of our databases, we will
notify customers by [posting a release note](/geoip/release-notes).

## Download limits

*MaxMind reserves the right to [limit the number of
downloads](https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-faq/general/is-there-a-limit-to-how-often-i-can-download-a-database-from-my-maxmind-account/)
made within a limited period of time.*
