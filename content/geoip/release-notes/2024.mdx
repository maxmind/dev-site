<ReleaseNote date="2024-02-13" title="No GeoNames Monthly Diff Report for February 2024">

Due to irregularities in the latest GeoNames data, we will be maintaining the
location names and codes from January.
[See the Monthly Diff Report for January 2024.](/geoip/release-notes/2024#geonames-monthly-diff-report-january-2024)

When the irregularities in the GeoNames data are resolved, we will update the
data and post a new Diff Report.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-25" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on February 7, 2024">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests March 13, 2024. To help customers get ready for this
change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
February 7, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to February 7, 2024.

If you have not made the requested changes before Wednesday, February 7, 2024,
you might experience a period where web service or database download requests
fail.

You can view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads
on our Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)
- [GeoIP and GeoLite database downloads](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases)
- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

**Please note:** This enforcement will also affect minFraud API requests. If you
are also a minFraud user,
[see our minFraud release note on this issue.](/minfraud/release-notes/2024#api-policies---temporary-enforcement-on-february-7-2024).

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-17" title="Presigned URLs for database downloads">

We will begin using R2 presigned URLs for all database downloads in order to
increase the security and reliability of our services.

**What do I need to do?**

MaxMind users who download databases should make sure that their HTTP client
follows redirects and there are no proxy or firewall settings that would block
requests to the host we are redirecting to. We will redirect requests using
HTTPS on the following hostname:

- `mm-prod-geoip-databases.a2649acb697e2c09b632799562c076f2.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`

**If you use a direct-download method (most CSV downloaders):**

The permalinks from the download page in your account portal will not be
changing. You will be redirected from those permalinks to the R2 presigned URLs.

You can test to ensure that your server is properly configured by getting a
permalink from the account portal and using this permalink with the `curl` or
`wget` examples in
[our documentation on directly downloading databases](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases).

**If you use `geoipupdate` (most MMDB downloaders):**

We will be releasing a new major version that uses redirecting links. You can
test your server configuration by updating to this new major version in a
controlled environment before updating your version on production.

**If you download directly from the account portal:**

Check your firewall and browser security settings if you get errors when trying
to download.

**If you need more help:**

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-17" title="Anycast flag available for CSV format databases">

The Anycast data point is now available in all CVS format databases—and, as
[announced in a prior release note](/geoip/release-notes/2023#anycast-flag-available-for-geoip-web-services-and-databases),
it’s also available in all GeoIP web services and all MMDB format databases.

In most cases, the addition of a new field to CSV databases should be a
non-breaking change, but we recommend checking your integration to make sure
that it can accommodate the addition of new fields.

The field is present in the following GeoIP databases:

- GeoIP Country database
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

**GeoLite databases**

The Anycast field has also been added to the CSV version of GeoLite geolocation
databases, but the new field is intentionally blank. This allows the GeoIP
databases to continue to be drop-in replacements for GeoLite databases, so that
it's easy to upgrade.

The field is present in the following GeoLite databases:

- GeoLite Country database
- GeoLite City database

**Confirming your integration allows for new data points**

The new field has been added to the Blocks CSV files:
`{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv4.csv` and
`{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv6.csv`

The new field name, `is_anycast`, has been added to the right of existing fields
and the cell will either contain 1 (if the network is an Anycast network) or be
blank (if it is not). The overwhelming majority of networks are not Anycast, and
so this field will be blank in most cases.

If you're not sure whether you're using the MMDB format, the CSV format, or
both, you can
[learn how to check your account's database download history to determine whether you are downloading CSV files](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407114914843).

Please use the following example CSV files to test your integration:

- [GeoIP Enterprise example files](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise/#csv-example-files)
- [GeoIP City and Country example files](/geoip/docs/databases/city-and-country/#csv-example-files)

We have also updated our tutorials on importing GeoIP databases. Please see
relevant links below:

- [Importing to PostgreSQL](/geoip/importing-databases/postgresql)
- [Importing to MySQL](/geoip/importing-databases/mysql)

[GeoNames Monthly Diff Report (January 2024)](/csv-files/GeoNames-Monthly-Diff-Report-January-2024.csv)

GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases incorporate
[GeoNames geographical data](https://www.geonames.org/), which is made available
under the
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Monthly updates to GeoNames data are incorporated into our databases as we
refresh them. Above you will find a CSV report of these changes as they apply to
English place names for the month of January as they relate to the following
fields:

- `geoname_id`
- `country_name`
- `country_code`
- `city_name`
- `subdivision_1_iso_code`
- `subdivision_2_iso_code`

Note that the values for the `old_` and `new_` columns for a given field only
differ for the field defined in the `diff_in` column.

\* In this month's update a large number of cities in Argentina have improved
place names.
