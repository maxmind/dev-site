{{< release-note date="2025-12-17" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in additional countries">}}

Effective tomorrow, Thursday, December 18, 2025, we will be blanking out the subdivision, city, and postal fields more often in the following countries. This change will result in fewer resolutions in: 

- Amman, Jordan
- Budapest, Hungary
- Reykjavik, Iceland
- All cities in Austria
- All cities in South Africa
- All cities in Vietnam

We will also be blanking out city and postal fields more often for cell networks in: 
- India
- Mexico
- United States

This change is to reduce false positives when the end users of a network are dispersed all over the country.

The update will be reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service
- minFraud Factors web service
- minFraud Insights web service

{{< release-note date="2025-11-28" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in additional countries">}}

Effective Monday, December 1, 2025, we will be blanking out the subdivision, city, and postal fields more often in the following countries. This change will result in fewer resolutions in: 

- Belgium
- Israel
- Italy
- The Netherlands
- Portugal
- Sweden
- Ukraine

We will also be blanking out city and postal fields more often for cell networks in: 
- Canada
- United States

This change is to reduce false positives when the end users of a network are dispersed all over the country. Many of the networks affected by this change are cell networks, which are often allocated across a wide area spanning one or more subdivisions.

The update will be reflected in the following products and services:

- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service
- minFraud Factors web service
- minFraud Insights web service

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-11-20" title="IP risk snapshot output added to traits object in the Insights web services">}}

We have added the [`ip_risk_snapshot`](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits__ip_risk_snapshot) to the traits object in our GeoIP Insights web service and our minFraud Insights and Factors web services. This field contains the risk associated with the IP address. The value ranges from 0.01 to 99. A higher score indicates a higher risk.

The IP risk snapshot is not a replacement for the minFraud IP risk score (`ip_address/risk`). 

The IP risk snapshot is based on an analysis of historical risk on the IP address, while the minFraud IP risk score is a responsive data field that generates an IP risk score in real time based on the transactions you send and activity from across the minFraud network. 

minFraud customers may find the IP risk snapshot output useful to determine whether an IP address is risky based on historical activity versus a current, emerging issue. A lower `traits/ip_risk_snapshot` score combined with a higher minFraud `ip_address/risk` score would mean that the IP address is becoming risky in real time based on the traffic on your and other customers' networks. A high score in both `ip_risk_snapshot` and minFraud IP risk score would mean that the IP address has been risky for a longer time.

Client APIs have been updated to reflect this change. 

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-11-19" title="New anonymizer data added to web services">}}

We have added an [`anonymizer` object](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#anonymizer) to our web services. This object contains the anonymizer data previously found in the `traits` object together with new outputs.

Anonymizer data in the `traits` object is being marked as deprecated. However, for backwards compatibility, anonymizer data in the `traits` object will continue to be populated and the functionality remains the same. This will not be a breaking change. 

We recommend updating your integrations to use the new `anonymizer` object, which contains data points not found in the `traits` object:

| new data | description |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `anonymizer/confidence`                       | A score ranging from 1 to 99 that represents our percent confidence that the network is currently part of an actively used VPN service.| 
| `anonymizer/network_last_seen`                | The last day that the network was sighted in our analysis of anonymized networks. This is in the ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
|  `anonymizer/provider_name`                  | The name of the VPN provider (e.g., NordVPN, SurfShark, etc.) associated with the network. |

Client APIs have been updated to reflect this change, which applies to the following web services: 
- GeoIP Insights
- minFraud Insights
- minFraud Factors 

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-11-18" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in selected cities and countries">}}

- All cities in Argentina 
- All cities in France 
- All cities in Germany 
- All cities in Ireland 
- All cities in Poland 
- All cities in South Korea
- All cities in Switzerland
- All cities in Taiwan
- All cities in the United Kingdom

\* \* Due to some irregularities in the data, we elected not to update GeoNames
data in August 2025 through September 2025. These issues have now been resolved
and we are resuming regular GeoNames updates. As a result, this month's GeoNames
update contains a larger number of differences than typical for a monthly
update. These changes are expected.

{{< release-note date="2025-10-14" title="GeoIP Anonymous Plus database size decrease">}}

The GeoIP Anonymous Plus database has significantly decreased in size due to an
expected change to how we handle some low confidence networks.

A large number of lower confidence VPN networks have been removed from the GeoIP
Anonymous Plus database. We have removed these networks in order to prevent
false positives because we believe that the confidence was too low.

The GeoIP Anonymous IP database was not released on Saturday, February 15 or
Sunday, February 16, 2025.

This delay was due to a small issue with our deployment process. This issue has
been resolved.

The GeoIP Anonymous IP database will return to its regular release schedule on
Monday, February 17, 2025.

{{< release-note date="2025-02-05" title="Update—Identifying Verizon 5g Home Internet" >}}

As announced in our
[previous release note](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/release-notes/2025/#identifying-verizon-5g-home-internet),
we are reclassifying a portion of Verizon Wireless networks in the United
States.

In addition to reclassifying the ISP name from `Verizon Wireless` to
`Verizon 5g Home Internet`, we will also be reclassifying the organization name
for consistency.

Starting on Friday, February 7, networks that have their ISP name set to
`Verizon 5g Home Internet` will also have their organization name set to
`Verizon 5g Home Internet`.

The following products and services will be affected:

- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP Insights and City Plus web services
- GeoIP ISP database
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-01-27" title="Identifying Verizon 5g Home Internet" >}}

Starting on Tuesday, February 4, we will be making changes to identify more
fixed wireless networks. We are starting with Verizon Wireless networks in the
United States.

Beginning with database releases on Tuesday, February 4, about 15% of traffic
previously identified with ISP name `Verizon Wireless` will be reclassified.

These networks will have their ISP name set to `Verizon 5g Home Internet` and
they will have their `user_type` set to `residential`. Their `connection_type`
will remain set to `Cellular`.

The following products and services will be affected:

- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP Insights and City Plus web services
- GeoIP ISP database
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services

{{< release-note date="2025-01-21" title="metro_code deprecation in GeoIP" >}}

The `metro_code` data in our GeoIP products and services is a
no-longer-maintained code. Because Google does not use or publish these codes
any longer, the `metro_code` field has now been deprecated in our GeoIP products
and services.

**What should I do?**

The field will not be removed from our databases and existing values will
continue to be populated, so you can continue using it if you find it valuable.
