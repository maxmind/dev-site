We are planning to make a number of data changes to the minFraud Legacy
Standard and Premium, and GeoIP Legacy City and Insights (formerly Omni) web
services at the end of May 2022. Please see our [blog
post](https://blog.maxmind.com/2020/06/15/data-changes-to-geoip-legacy-and-minfraud-legacy-web-services-in-may-2022/)
for more information, and how to prepare.

**New minFraud APIs are available:** Please see
[What’s New in minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors](/minfraud/whats-new-in-minfraud-score-and-minfraud-insights)
and our [minFraud Insights, minFraud Score, and minFraud Factors API documentation](/minfraud).

The minFraud web service is available using a simple URI-based API. To use this
service, you must have a valid
[MaxMind license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key).

## Client APIs

We encourage you to use one our minFraud client APIs if possible. APIs are
available in the following languages:

{/* <!--lint enable maximum-line-length --> */}

The client APIs take care of formatting requests and parsing the response for
you.

## Report Transactions

If you are using our minFraud transaction fraud detection service, we also
encourage you to use our
[report transaction service](/minfraud/report-a-transaction/). By reporting
false positives and instances of fraud to us, you can help us refine our
algorithms, so we can reduce false positives and catch more fraud.

## Device Tracking Add-on

You may optionally include [some JavaScript](/minfraud/track-devices/) on your
site that helps us identify the device your customer is using to determine
whether it has been used in previous fraudulent transactions. The device
information is factored into the scores returned through the minFraud service.

## HTTP API

If an API for your language is not available, you can use the “raw” API detailed
below.

The HTTP API requires you to pass a set of parameters as an HTTP GET or POST.
Results are returned in a simple text format documented below.

The URI for this service is `https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/v1.0/legacy`.

The `minfraud.maxmind.com` hostname automatically picks the data center
geographically closest to you.

### Security

The API is only available via HTTPS. If you attempt to access this service via
HTTP, you will receive a `403 Forbidden` HTTP response.

We require TLS 1.2 or greater for all requests to our servers to keep your data
secure.

### Input

The minFraud API accepts input in a query string or as a form post
(application/x-www-form-urlencoded). It accepts the following fields. The name
of each field should be used as the query string or form field name. Field names
*are* case-sensitive.

The length of the data passed to us does not matter for most fields. We will
truncate inputs as needed. However, for a few fields the length is important,
and this is noted in the table below.

String fields are limited to no more than 255 Unicode characters unless a
shorter length is specified. Of course, many fields also have additional
constraints that limit the length. For example, the `ip_address` field cannot be
longer than the longest valid representation of an IPv6 address.

### Output

The minFraud service returns its output as a set of fields separated by
semicolons (;). Each field consists of a name and value separated by an equals
sign (=). The field values are not escaped, but will never contain a semicolon
or equals sign.

All strings are returned in the
[ISO-8859-1 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1). This
encoding is also referred to as latin1.

Here is an example of the output with just a few fields:

`riskScore=13.2;distance=6;countryMatch=Yes;countryCode=US;freeMail=Yes`

The API version column indicates in what version of the API a field was added.
You can explicitly
[ask for responses in older API formats](https://www.maxmind.com/en/minfraud_version).
By default, all new users will receive responses for the version that was
current when they signed up for the service. The latest version is 1.3.
