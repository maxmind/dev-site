  This object contains information about the device that MaxMind believes is
  associated with the IP address passed in the request.

  <Property
    name="confidence"
    tags={{
      'Format': 'Decimal',
      'Min': 0.01,
      'Max': 99,
    }}
  >
    A number from 0.01 to 99 representing the confidence that the `/device/id`
    refers to a unique device as opposed to a cluster of similar devices. A
    confidence of 0.01 indicates very low confidence that the device is unique,
    whereas 99 indicates very high confidence.
  </Property>

  <Property
    name="id"
    tags={{
      'Format': 'UUID',
    }}
  >
    A UUID that MaxMind uses for the device associated with this IP address.
    Note that many devices cannot be uniquely identified because they are too
    common (for example, all iPhones of a given model and OS release). In these
    cases, the minFraud service will simply not return a UUID for that device.
    This is only available if you are using the
    [Device Tracking Add-on](/minfraud/api-documentation#device-tracking-add-on).
  </Property>

  <Property
    name="last_seen"
    tags={{
      'Max Length': 255,
    }}
  >
    The date and time of the last sighting of the device. The value is formatted
    according to [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
  </Property>

  <Property
    name="local_time"
    tags={{
      'Max Length': 255,
    }}
  >
    The local date and time of the transaction in the time zone of the device.
    This is determined by using the UTC offset associated with the device.
    The value is formatted according to [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
