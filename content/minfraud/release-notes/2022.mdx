<ReleaseNote date="2022-03-01" title="Expanded filtering options in the account portal for minFraud transactions">
The transaction review screen in your MaxMind account portal now has expanded
options to filter your transactions. You may now filter transactions by:

- **account user ID:** the user ID of the end-user who initiated the transaction
- **shop ID:** used to identify the storefront or merchant associated with the
transaction
- **issuer ID number:** the issuer ID number (IIN), sometimes called a bank ID
number (BIN) of the card used in the transaction
- **custom rule ID:** the ID for the custom rule that was triggered for the
transaction

[You can learn more about how to filter and search transactions using your
MaxMind account portal on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408755037851-Search-the-Log-of-my-minFraud-Transactions)

<ReleaseNote date="2022-01-31" title="minFraud services now handle 8 digit IINs">
We have updated the minFraud service to handle 8 digit credit card issuer ID
numbers (IINs). These are non-breaking changes.

- The `credit_card/issuer_id_number` input can now receive 6 or 8 digits.
- The `credit_card/last_4_digits` input has been renamed
`credit_card/last_digits`, and receives 2 or 4 of the last digits of the credit
card.
  - The `credit_card/last_4_digits` input will continue to work as an alias for
  the new `credit_card/last_digits` input.
- In some cases with longer IINs we will truncate the `credit_card/last_digits`
input so that we process only the data required for risk scoring. If we truncate
the last digits, the minFraud service will return a warning message.
- If you send 8 digits for the `credit_card/issuer_id_number`, but we do not
recognize an 8 digit IIN, we will truncate the input to 6 digits. If we truncate
the IIN, the minFraud service will return a warning message.

Learn more about how to pass the correct number of digits for credit card inputs
in our developer portal:
- [`credit_card/issuer_id_number`](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/requests?lang=en#schema--request--credit-card__issuer_id_number)
- [`credit_card/last_digits`](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/requests?lang=en#schema--request--credit-card__last_digits)

You can read more about these changes in [the announcement on our
blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2022/01/minfraud-now-supports-8-digit-iins).

<ReleaseNote date="2022-01-10" title="minFraud subscores are now minFraud risk factor scores">
We have renamed minFraud subscores to be "risk factor scores" to make it clearer
that the scores returned in our minFraud Factors web service are actionable risk
scores in their own right, similar to the IP risk score. [You can learn more
about all of minFraud's risk scores on our knowledge
base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408225354907-Risk-Scores)

Nothing has changed about how to use our web services, and no changes are
required to your current integration. Specifically, the JSON response for
minFraud Factors queries will continue to return risk factor scores in the
`subscores` object. [Learn more about the subscores
object.](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses?lang=en#schema--response--subscores)
