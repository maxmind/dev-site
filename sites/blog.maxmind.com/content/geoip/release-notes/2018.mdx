title: GeoIP2 Release Notes - 2018 Archive
---

<ReleaseNote date="2018-11-19" title="Initial release of GeoIP2-node">
We have added Node.js as a MaxMind Supported GeoIP2 API
([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maxmind/geoip2-node),
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-node)). It provides an API for the
GeoIP2 databases, and will provide an API for the GeoIP2 Precision web
services. This API also works with MaxMind's free GeoLite2 databases.

<ReleaseNote date="2018-09-21" title="Changes to US coordinate data">
On Monday, October 1st, we will be changing a large amount of our U.S.
coordinate (latitude & longitude) data\* to use
[GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) coordinates for postal codes. This change
will ensure greater consistency during our build processes. Around 95% of US
coordinates will change with most moving about 1 mile. About 5 to 10% of US
coordinates will move by more than 10 miles.

_\* Coordinate data is approximate and is not precise. It should not be used to
identify a particular street address or household as it refers to a larger
geographical area instead of a precise location._

<ReleaseNote date="2018-08-14" title="Mapping IPs to districts of Seoul">
Effective August 21st, we will be mapping IP addresses to [Districts (Gu) of
Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Seoul) instead of
Seoul. This will allow customers to have a more precise mapping, similar to how
we map IPs to New York City and London boroughs, and Tokyo's special wards. We
will continue to map some IPs to Seoul if we are unable to determine the
specific district the IP is located in. We will also continue to map IPs
located in the central Jung District to Seoul, similar to how we map IPs in
Manhattan to New York and IPs in Chūō to Tokyo.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2018-07-17" title="Mapping more IPs to special wards of Tokyo">
Effective July 24th, we will be mapping more IP addresses to [special wards of
Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo) instead of Tokyo
itself. This will allow customers to have a more precise mapping, similar to
how we map IPs to New York City and London boroughs. We will continue to map
some IPs to Tokyo if we are unable to determine the specific special ward the
IP is located in.

<ReleaseNote date="2018-07-03" title="Renaming Time Warner Cable to Spectrum">
Effective July 10th, we will update the ISP and Organization data to replace
the Time Warner Cable name with the name Spectrum, as these two ISPs have
merged and Time Warner Cable has been rebranded as Spectrum.
</ReleaseNote>

 <ReleaseNote date="2018-05-25" title="New European Union locations added to GeoIP2 databases and services">
Effective May 29, 2018, we will be adding Åland Islands, Martinique, Mayotte,
Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion, and Saint Martin to the list of European
Union locations identified by the GeoIP2 Country, GeoIP2 City, and GeoIP2
Enterprise databases and GeoIP2 Precision services responses.
</ReleaseNote>

 <ReleaseNote date="2018-04-18" title="Discontinuation of the GeoLite Legacy databases">
We have decided to discontinue the GeoLite Legacy databases on January 2,
2019. As part of that process, updated versions of the GeoLite Legacy databases
are now only available to [redistribution license
customers](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite-commercial-redistribution-license),
although anyone can continue to download the March 2018 GeoLite Legacy builds.
Starting January 2, 2019, the last build will be removed from our website.
GeoLite Legacy database users will need to switch to
the [GeoLite2](/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) or [commercial
GeoIP databases](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases) and
update their integrations by January 2, 2019. Correspondingly, we have decided
against removing latitude and longitude coordinates from the GeoLite2
databases. We are in the process of reviewing coordinates used in all of our
GeoLite2 and GeoIP databases to ensure there is no risk of misuse.
</ReleaseNote>

 <ReleaseNote date="2018-02-13" title="EU Country outputs added to to GeoIP2 Country, City, Enterprise DBs and Precision service">
We have added additional outputs to the GeoIP2 Country, GeoIP2 City, and GeoIP2
Enterprise databases and to the GeoIP2 Precision Services. The outputs are:

- EU Country: `/country/is_in_european_union` – Country of the location of the
IP address in an EU member state
- EU Registered Country: `/registered_country/is_in_european_union` – Country
registered by the ISP or organization is an EU member state

_GeoIP2 Country, GeoIP2 City, and GeoIP2 Enterprise CSV databases will have a
new column added to the location files named “is_in_european_union”. This will
be “1” if the country is in the European Union and “0” otherwise._
