## Generate a License Key for the Sandbox

## Build your integration

Consult our [quick start guide](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction?lang=en) or our
[list of client
APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction?lang=en#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) to
develop your integration.

## Point your integration to the Sandbox service endpoints

Use the service endpoints for the Sandbox version of the web services, as
listed in the table below:

| Sandbox Service | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                             |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Score           | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/score`    |
| Insights        | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/insights` |
| Factors         | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/factors`  |

Remember to use the license key generated by your Sandbox account to
authenticate your requests.

## Test data for the Sandbox minFraud service

<Alert type="info">
The Sandbox will return risk scores and risk data, but this data is not
accurate and should not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the minFraud
scoring engine, or for geolocation or IP intelligence. It is designed
for testing purposes only.
</Alert>

You may only submit approved test data to the Sandbox version of the minFraud
services. At this time, the only approved test transaction data are the three IP
addresses listed below. You can submit transactions to Sandbox minFraud services
with any of the following IP addresses as the [`/device/ip_address`](/minfraud/api-documentation/requests?lang=en#schema--request--device__ip_address)
input. You should receive a minFraud response with risk scores and risk data.
The IP risk score output ([`/ip_address/risk`](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses?lang=en#schema--response--ip-address__risk))
will contain the expected response below.

| Test IP Address Input | Test IP Risk Score Output |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `146.243.121.22`      | 75                        |
| `152.216.7.110`       | 0.01                      |
| `23.10.87.103`        | 0.01                      |

You should not submit real transaction data to the Sandbox version of the
minFraud services, but you can submit transactions with dummy data.

## Test Legacy versions of minFraud using the Sandbox

You can control which version of the minFraud services your Sandbox account
simulates so that you can test your integrations with various versions. This may
help with upgrading from minFraud Legacy.
