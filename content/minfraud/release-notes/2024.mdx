<ReleaseNote date="2024-03-13" title="API policies are now permanently enforced">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, our API policies are now being permanently enforced as of March
13, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind only accepts API and database download requests that are sent to the
  appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** Ensure that you are using the correct hostname for
your API requests, and that you are using HTTPS. Failure to do so will result in
web service or database download requests failing.

You can view the appropriate URIs for minFraud services on our Developer Portal
using the links below:

**Please note:** This enforcement will also affect GeoIP web service and
database download requests. If you are also a GeoIP user,

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-25" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on February 7, 2024">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests on March 13, 2024. To help customers get ready for
this change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
February 7, 2024.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** To ensure that your MaxMind service is not
interrupted, please ensure ensure that you are using the correct hostname for
your API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to February 7, 2024.

If you have not made the requested changes before Wednesday, February 7, 2024,
you might experience a period where web service or database download requests
fail.

<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-22" title="minFraud no longer accepts event times more than one year in the past">

Starting tomorrow, January 23, 2024, minFraud will no longer accept
`/event/time` inputs with values more than one year in the past. Most customers
do not need to send the `/event/time` input and will not be impacted by this
change.
[Learn more about this input and how to use it to score historical transactions on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/5452006111003-Event-and-Account-Inputs#h_01G0Z3WBNAP5Y8WNRR156EJBBF)

If you send the `/event/time` inputs with values more than one year in the past,
minFraud will:

- replace the event time with the current time
- score the transaction and return a score
- return an `INPUT_INVALID` warning with its response
