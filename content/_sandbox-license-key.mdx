In order to test the web services in the Sandbox environment, you will need
to generate a license key from your Sandbox account. [Learn how to generate a
license key on our Knowledge
Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407111582235-Generate-a-License-Key)
The process is the same for your Sandbox account, but you must login to your
Sandbox account [(direct
link)](https://sandbox.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key) rather than
your regular MaxMind account.
