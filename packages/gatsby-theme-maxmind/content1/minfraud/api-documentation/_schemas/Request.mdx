  Currently minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors use the same
  request document format. The request consists of a JSON object with one or
  more of the fields shown below. Each key in the top-level object maps to an
  object or array as described below. New fields that apply to one or both may
  be added in the future.

  String fields are limited to no more than 255 valid Unicode characters unless
  a shorter length is specified; the null and newline characters are forbidden.
  Of course, many fields also have additional constraints that limit the length.
  For example, the `ip_address` field cannot be longer than the longest valid
  representation of an IPv6 address. Unless it must match a specific format, it
  is valid for a string field to be empty.

  Boolean fields must be provided as JSON `true` or `false`.

  Unless otherwise specified, if the value meets the requirements for the field,
  then it will not be modified. Beyond field specific exceptions, an exception
  to this is if the value is provided as a type different from what we require.
  In such cases we convert it to the required type if possible. For example, if
  you provide a string field as a number, then it will be converted to a string,
  and vice versa. This conversion happens only between numbers and strings.

  The entire request body is limited to 20,000 bytes. Requests larger than this
  size will be rejected.
