provider.

<ReleaseNote date="2017-10-31" title="The legacy GeoIP JavaScript services have been discontinued">
We have discontinued the legacy GeoIP JavaScript services, which used the
endpoints http://js.maxmind.com/js/country.js and
http://js.maxmind.com/js/geoip.js. If you still have not upgraded your
integration to use the [GeoIP2 JavaScript Client
API](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/client-side-javascript) or are
encountering problems with your legacy GeoIP JavaScript services, you can find
more information about what to do by clicking
[here](/geoip/legacy/migrating-away-from-our-legacy-geoip-javascript-services/).

<ReleaseNote date="2017-10-10" title="Our Singapore server is live">
Our Singapore server is now live. GeoIP2 Precision and GeoIP web service
customers – if you hardcode any of our IPs in your application or your
firewall, please make sure you have added the new server IP addresses to your
list:

- IPv4 address: 169.55.62.55
- IPv6 address: 2607:f0d0:3:2d::4
- hostname: geoip-as-southeast.maxmind.com

<ReleaseNote date="2017-09-27" title="Crimea accuracy update">
We completed our most recent review and update of Geolocation for Crimea. Our
accuracy has increased as follows:

Approximately 89% of website visitors who are from Crimea are currently located
by GeoIP as being in Crimea. Approximately 97% of the visitors who are located
in Crimea by GeoIP are actually in Crimea.

We currently locate Crimea in Ukraine, as we use GeoNames data and they locate
Crimea in Ukraine. If GeoNames locates Crimea in Russia in the future, we will
follow their change and post an announcement here as well as on
[https://twitter.com/maxmind](https://twitter.com/maxmind).

In legacy GeoIP, we return a FIPS region code of 11 or 20. In GeoIP2, we return
a iso code of 40 or 43 in the subdivision object.

Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond our
control, we cannot guarantee any specific future accuracy level. Further,
accuracy figures are subject to change as IP networks are reallocated.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-08-17" title="EOL legacy GeoIP JavaScript">
On October 31, 2017, we will discontinue our legacy GeoIP JavaScript services,
which use the endpoints http://js.maxmind.com/js/country.js and
http://js.maxmind.com/js/geoip.js. Please upgrade your legacy GeoIP integration
to use our [GeoIP2 JavaScript Client
API](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/client-side-javascript) before
that date.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-07-24" title="Mapping more mobile networks to regional level">
We will be mapping additional mobile (cellular) networks to a region
(subdivision) rather than city level. This change will only occur where the
confidence in the city data is low due to the mobile provider allocating IPs
over a wide area.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-07-10" title="Removing additional anycast locations">
The geographical location for anycast CloudFlare networks: `104.16.0.0/12`,
`162.159.0.0/16`, `190.93.244.0/22`, `198.41.192.0/19` have been removed.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-06-23" title="Adding Multiple License Keys Support">
Our Account Portal has been updated to include the ability for our customers to
create and manage multiple license keys.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-06-11" title="Removing anycast locations">
We are removing the geographical location for the anycast CloudFlare network
`141.101.112.0/20`. Anycast networks can be routed to a number of different
locations all around the world, typically based on what is the nearest
location. Over the next few weeks, we may remove the geographical location for
additional anycast networks, including more CloudFlare networks as well as
Google public DNS servers `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-05-09" title="New GeoLite2 ASN Database">
Our [GeoLite2 ASN database](/geoip/docs/databases) is now provided in a CSV
format suitable for importing into a SQL database as well as a GeoLite2 ASN
database in our MaxMind DB binary format. You can [download the database
here](/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/). GeoLite2 databases may also be downloaded and
updated with our [GeoIP Update program](/geoip/geoipupdate/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-05-08" title="Spectrum rebranding">
We've updated the ISP and Organization data to replace the _Charter
Communications_ and _Bright House Networks_ data points with the data point
_Spectrum_, as these two ISPs have merged and been rebranded as _Spectrum_.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2017-03-05" title="GeoIP ISP Accuracy Improvements in Europe and Latin America">
The GeoIP databases and services providing ISP and Organization data have been
updated. The change is to a number of European and Latin Americans ISPs. We've
updated the ISP name to use the common trade name instead of the legal name.
This will make it easier to recognize the ISP.

Please note that if you use this data point, for example, to flag a visitor if
they change ISP, you may need to adjust your implementation in order to avoid
false positive flags.

The ISP name changes include the following:

- `Proximus Skynet` to `Skynet Belgium`
- `Telefonica Germany` to `O2 Deutschland`
- `Telefonica Movil De Chile S.A.` to `Movistar Movil Chile`
- `Tele Danmark` to `TDC Danmark`
