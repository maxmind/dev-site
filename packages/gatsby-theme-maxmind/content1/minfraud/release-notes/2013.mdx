<ReleaseNote date="2013-09-17" title="Adding IPv6 access for web endpoints">
We're excited to roll out IPv6 access for our web endpoints over the next few
months. The rollout will be gradual to ensure a minimum of disruption for
clients. We will be adding AAAA records for hostnames on the dates specified
below. Most clients aren't yet using IPv6 and should notice no issues. Clients
with properly configured IPv6 should also notice no issues. If you have any
questions or issues, please email us at support@maxmind.com.

The AAAA address for US West servers will be 2607:f0d0:3:7::4.

The AAAA address for US East servers will be 2607:f0d0:3:8::4.

<ReleaseNote date="2013-07-03" title="Upcoming IP address changes for MaxMind services">
In the coming weeks, we will be changing the IP addresses of our web service
servers. If you hardcode any of our IPs in your application or your firewall,
then please read the information below. If you don't hardcode our IPs, then
you can stop reading now, as this change should have no effect on you.

Summary

Currently, we use the following IPs for a variety of hostnames:

- US East: 174.36.207.186
- US West: 50.97.220.226

On Tuesday, July 16th, 2013, DNS for our US West servers will change from
50.97.220.226 to 108.168.254.117.

On Tuesday, July 30th, 2013, DNS for our US East servers will change from
174.36.207.186 to 108.168.255.243.

This will affect all of the hostnames listed below.

If you hardcode our IPs, we encourage you to add the new IPs to your firewall
or application before the switchover date. If you don't, you may experience an
interruption in service. The new IPs are live now, and though we won't change
DNS until the dates specified above, you may begin directing traffic to them
now if you wish.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to email us at
support@maxmind.com.
