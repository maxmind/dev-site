<Alert type="info">
The Sandbox will return geolocation and IP intelligence data, but this data is
not accurate and should not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the minFraud
scoring engine, or for geolocation or IP intelligence. It is designed for
testing purposes only.
</Alert>

There are a limited number of IP addresses in the test database for the GeoIP
web services on the Sandbox. The Sandbox versions of the GeoIP web services use
the same data as our test databases, which are published to Github:

- The Sandbox version of our GeoIP City Plus and Insights web service both use
the [Precision Enterprise test database](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB/blob/main/source-data/GeoIP2-Precision-Enterprise-Test.json).
- The Sandbox version of our GeoIP Country web service uses the [Country test
database](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB/blob/main/source-data/GeoIP2-Country-Test.json).

If you attempt to submit an IP address that doesn't exist in the test data for
the appropriate service, you will receive an error stating that the IP address
does not exist in our database.

The test data is displayed in JSON format, and would be the expected response
for a query using the listed IP address. [Learn more about working with our
GeoIP test data on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/8610782760731-Sandbox-for-the-GeoIP-Web-Services#h_01GC7FJGRWC116ZCDPAJP09V9M)
