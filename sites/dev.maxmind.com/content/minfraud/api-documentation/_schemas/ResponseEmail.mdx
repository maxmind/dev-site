    address or email domain is provided.

  <Property
    name="is_free"

    This field is `true` if MaxMind believes that this email domain is for a

    domain is not for a known free email provider. The key will only be present
    if a valid email address or email domain is provided.

  <Property
    name="is_high_risk"

    This field is `true` if MaxMind believes that this email address is likely
    to be used for fraud. It is `false` if MaxMind does not believe the address
    is used for fraud. The key will only be present if a valid email address or
    email address hash is provided. Note that this is also factored into the
    overall `risk_score` in the response as well.
