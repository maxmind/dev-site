<ReleaseNote date="2023-03-16" title="New License Key Format">

We have updated the format of our license keys. New license keys will be longer,
with a six character prefix.

The new license keys can be used in all current versions of our Client APIs and
in version 3.1.1 and higher of
[our GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases).

No action is required. Existing license keys will still be valid and will
continue to function normally.

</ReleaseNote>
