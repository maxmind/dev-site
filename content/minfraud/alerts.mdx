title: minFraud Alerts
---

After initial scoring, we continue to monitor transactions with risk scores less
than or equal to 10 for another 24 hours. If we receive new information related
to these transactions that lead to a transaction having a re-calculated risk
score greater than or equal to 75, we send out a minFraud Alert.

You can receive minFraud Alerts via email or webhook.

## Receive minFraud Alerts via email

You can set an email where you would like to receive minFraud Alerts through the
[minFraud Alert configuration screen in your account
portal](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/minfraud/alerts/settings)
(login required).

## Receive minFraud Alerts via webhook

You can also receive minFraud Alerts by webhook, and integrate your own response
to these alerts on your server. You can configure your minFraud Alert webhook
settings through the [minFraud Alert configuration screen in your account
portal](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/minfraud/alerts/settings)
(login required).

### Configuration

The alert webhook URL should be an HTTPS endpoint that accepts `GET` requests.
The User-Agent of the minFraud Alert service is `MaxMind MinFraud Alert Robot`.
