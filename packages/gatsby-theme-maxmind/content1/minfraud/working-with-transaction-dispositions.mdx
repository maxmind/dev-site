title: Working with Transaction Dispositions
---

With minFraud Interactive, customers can create Custom Rules that are used to
assign a disposition to every transaction received in a minFraud request.
Custom Rules can set a transaction’s disposition to `accept`, `reject`, or
`manual_review`. For more information on Custom Rules and Dispositions, see the
documentation in our [Support Center](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-interactive/).

After transactions are received, customers can use the [minFraud Interactive interface](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-interactive/)
to review all transactions dispositioned as `manual_review`. Transactions can
then either be `accept`ed or `reject`ed, and/or have a note added. In order for
these manual updates made in minFraud Interactive to be useful, they need to
find their way back into customers’ systems. The Dispositions API allows
customers to get a list of the manual updates and notes made to their
transactions.

**You only need to implement the Dispositions API if you (1) use the minFraud
Interactive interface to make manual changes to dispositions, and (2) require
those changes to propagate to your own system.**

## Making a disposition request

To make a disposition request, you need the request URI and parameters, and
[your MaxMind account ID and license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key).

### Request URI and parameters

API calls should be made with HTTP GET request to
`https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/disposition/v1.0/updates`.

We require a URL parameter called `updates_after` with an RFC 3339 timestamp
value.  This value is an exclusive lower bound for the updates; only updates
made after this time will be returned.

For example, to get updates after March 15, 2021 at 9 AM UTC, your request
would look like:
`https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/disposition/v1.0/updates?updates_after=2021-03-15T09:00:00.00000Z`

### Authorization and Security

The HTTP Authorization header is required for authorization. The username is
your [MaxMind account
ID](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key). The password is
your [MaxMind license
key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).  The
authorization realm is `minfraud`.

<Alert type="warning">
  You must be approved for a trial or purchase credit for use with our web
  services in order to receive an account ID and license key.
</Alert>

We use basic HTTP authentication. The APIs which require authentication are
only available via HTTPS. The credentials are never transmitted unencrypted. If
you attempt to access this service via HTTP, you will receive a `403 Forbidden`
HTTP response.

### Request headers

The `Accept` header for a request is entirely optional.  If you do include one,
you must accept one of the following:

* `application/json`
* `application/vnd.maxmind.com-disposition-updates+json`
* `application/vnd.maxmind.com-disposition-updates+json; charset=UTF-8; version=1.0`

If you set the `Accept-Charset` header in your client code, you must accept the
`UTF-8` character set. If you don't you will receive a `406 Not Acceptable`
response.

### Command Line Example Using curl

This example will get updates after March 15, 2021 at 9AM UTC. Please replace
`{account_id}` and `{license_key}` with your [account ID and
license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key)

```cli
curl -u "{account_id}:{license_key}" \
  https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/disposition/v1.0/updates\?updates_after\=2021-03-15T09:00:00.00000Z
```

## Response to successful requests

### Headers (successful)

The `Content-Type` header for a successful response is `application/vnd.maxmind.com-disposition-updates+json; charset=UTF-8; version=1.0`.

A `Content-Length` header will be provided.

### Body (successful)

Data will be returned as a JSON document in UTF-8 encoding. The document will
include two keys: `last_update_timestamp` and `updates`.

The `last_update_timestamp` value provides the relevant timestamp the last
returned transaction was sorted by, in RFC 3339 format (NB: this value is not
necessarily the earlier of the `*_last_updated` keys of the last included
transaction; this is why it’s being provided explicitly).

The `updates` value provides an array of transactions for
which the disposition and/or note have been manually updated, or, the
transaction’s manual review period has expired. The transactions will be sorted
from least recently updated to most recently updated, using the earliest
updated timestamp (either the disposition or note) after the `updates_after`
time for each transaction.

At most, 1000 updated transactions will be returned for any single request.
These will be the earliest updated transactions after the provided
`updates_after` timestamp, not the most recent. For each repeated request, the
`updates_after` request value should be replaced with the `last_update_timestamp`
value returned from the previous request.

Each transaction in the updates array will contain the following keys:

| Key                   | Value Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minfraud_id`         | UUID       | The transaction’s unique identifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `action`              | String     | The most recent transaction disposition action. In addition to `accept`, `reject`, and `manual_review`, you may also see `expired_review`, which indicates the manual review period (1 week) expired before the transaction was reviewed. |
| `action_last_updated` | Timestamp  | The date and time the disposition action was last updated, in RFC 3339 format with microsecond precision.                                                                                                                                 |
| `note`                | String     | The most recent transaction note. Limited to 500 characters.  Will be `null` if not currently set.                                                                                                                                        |
| `note_last_updated`   | Timestamp  | The date and time the note was last updated, in RFC 3339 format with microsecond precision.  If a note has never been set, this will be `null`                                                                                            |

As a note to implementers, we are considering adding additional keys to this
object in future versions of this API.

## Response to unsuccessful requests

### Headers (unsuccessful)

The `Content-Type` header for an unsuccessful response is
`application/vnd.maxmind.com-error+json; charset=UTF-8; version=1.0`.

A `Content-Length` header will be provided.

### Body (unsuccessful)

In the event an error occurs (the response indicates a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status),
the response may include a JSON document in the body. An error in content
negotiation will not include a body, nor will many 5xx errors, which typically
happen outside of our web service handling code. Before attempting to decode
the body as JSON, you should verify that the `Content-Type` of the error
response is `application/vnd.maxmind.com-error+json; charset=UTF-8;
version=1.0`.

If the JSON document is included in the response body, it will be a single
object with the keys `code` and `error`. The `code` field is a static error
code for machine use. The value of any given `code` will never change, though
`code`s can be added or removed. The `error` field is a human-readable
description of the error and may change at any time.

In addition to the errors documented below, client code should also be prepared
to handle any valid HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code.

| Code                   | HTTP Status                | Error                                                                                                                                                                       |
