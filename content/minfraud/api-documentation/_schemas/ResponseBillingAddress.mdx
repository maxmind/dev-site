    This field is `true` if the postal code provided with the address is in the
    city for the address. The field is `false` when the postal code is not in
    the city. The key will only be present when a billing postal code, city,
    and country have been provided.

    We use [GeoNames data](https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/postal-codes-us.html)
    for the postal-city match, which uses the [preferred place name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code#Preferred_place_names:_ZIP_Codes_and_previous_zoning_lines)
    for a US ZIP code. [Alternative place names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code#Preferred_place_names:_ZIP_Codes_and_previous_zoning_lines)
    for US ZIP codes may not trigger a match for this field.

  <Property
    name="distance_to_ip_location"
    type="integer"
  >
    The distance in kilometers from the address to the IP location. We fall back
    to country or subdivision information if we do not have postal or city
    information for an IP address, which may lead to inaccurate distance
    calculations.

  <Property
    name="is_in_ip_country"
  >
    This field is `true` if the address is in the IP country. The field is
    `false` when the address is not in the IP country. If the IP address could
    not be geolocated or no billing address was provided, the field will not be
    included in the response.
