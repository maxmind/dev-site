GeoLite2 databases are free IP geolocation databases comparable to, but less
accurate than, [MaxMind’s GeoIP2
databases](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases). The [GeoLite2 Country,
City, and ASN
databases](/static/pdf/GeoLite2-IP-MetaData-Databases-Comparison-Chart.pdf) are
updated weekly, every Tuesday. GeoLite2 data is also available as a web service
in the [GeoLite2 Country and GeoLite2 City web
services](/static/pdf/GeoLite2-and-GeoIP2-Precision-Web-Services-Comparison.pdf). Users of
the GeoLite2 web services are limited to 1000 IP address lookups per service
per day.

## Accessing GeoLite2 Free Geolocation Data

You will need a free GeoLite2 account to download the GeoLite2 databases or to
query the GeoLite2 web services.

From the side menu in your account portal, you can select
[“Download  Files”](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/geoip/downloads)
to download GeoLite2 databases in binary or CSV format. You can select
[“Manage License Keys”](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key)
to generate a license key, which can be used to automate GeoLite2 binary
database downloads with the
[GeoIP Update](/geoip/updating-databases/#using-geoip-update) program or query
the web services.

For more information about using GeoLite2, see our [section on
integration](#integration) below.

## IP Geolocation Accuracy

<Alert type="warning">
  ** IP Geolocation Usage**

  IP geolocation is inherently imprecise. Locations are often near the center of
  the population. Any location provided by a GeoIP database should not be used
  to identify a particular address or household.
</Alert>

Use the Accuracy Radius as an indication of geolocation accuracy for the
latitude and longitude coordinates we return for an IP address. The actual
location of the IP address is likely within the area defined by this radius and
the latitude and longitude coordinates.

You can compare accuracy of the GeoLite2 data and MaxMind's paid GeoIP2
products by selecting a country on our [GeoIP2 City Accuracy
page](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-accuracy-comparison).

## Integration

GeoLite2 databases and web services use nearly the same integration steps as
our paid GeoIP2 databases and web services.  In fact, our client API libraries
can be used for both GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 products, making transitioning from
the free GeoLite2 product line to the paid GeoIP2 product line extremely easy.

### Databases

See our [Database Documentation
page](/geoip/docs/databases#official-api-clients) for a list of available APIs.
GeoIP2 APIs may be used with GeoLite2 binary databases (MMDB). You can also use
the [GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases/#using-geoip-update) to
automatically keep your GeoLite2 binary format databases up to date.

GeoLite2 CSV databases are released in the same basic format as our [GeoIP2
CSV databases](/geoip/docs/databases/city-and-country#csv-databases), but they
may contain fewer data points.

### Web services

See our [Web Services Documentation
page](/geoip/docs/web-services#official-api-clients) for a list of available web
service APIs. GeoIP2 Precision APIs may be used with the GeoLite2 web services
by changing the hostname to the appropriate [GeoLite2 web service
URI](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints). Using the wrong host
will result in a [permission
error](https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-faq/general/why-am-i-getting-a-permission-error-when-querying-the-geolite2-web-services/).

You can also review our brief tutorial on [how to integrate the GeoLite2 City
web service using PHP on our
blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2021/01/11/integrating-maxminds-free-and-paid-ip-geolocation-web-services-in-php/).
