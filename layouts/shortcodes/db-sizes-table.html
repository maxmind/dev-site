  MaxMind databases can vary in size from release to release. If you are
  working with file size limitations that are concerning, you should build
  your integrations to fail gracefully in event of a significant size
  change.

  From {{ .Get "dateRange" }}, the database files varied in file size and number of networks as
  follows:
</p>

<div class="table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Database</th>
        <th>CSV File Size</th>
        <th>MMDB File Size</th>
        <th>IPv4 Networks</th>
        <th>IPv6 Networks</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {{.Inner}}
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  The listed file sizes are for unpacked databases. Databases are
  downloaded in a compressed format.
