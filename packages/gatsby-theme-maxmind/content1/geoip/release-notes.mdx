<ReleaseNote date="2021-10-13" title="Crimea geolocation accuracy update">
We completed our most recent review and update of geolocation for Crimea. Our
accuracy has increased as follows:

- Approximately 96% of website visitors who are from Crimea are currently
located by GeoIP2 as being in Crimea.
- Approximately 99% of the visitors who are located in Crimea by GeoIP2 are
actually in Crimea.

Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond our
control, we cannot guarantee any specific future accuracy level. Further,
accuracy figures are subject to change as IP networks are reallocated.

<ReleaseNote date="2021-09-28" title="Update to geolocation databases to fix Japanese geolocations">
We are releasing an update for our GeoIP2 Country, City, and Enterprise
databases, and for our GeoIP2 Precision Country, City, and Insights web services
to fix a bug that geolocated about 0.1% of IP addresses located in Japan to the
wrong country and the wrong coordinates.

When the updated databases are released today, you will be able to download them
via [your account
portal](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/geoip/downloads), or using
[your GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases). If you use any of the
GeoIP2 Precision web services, you will have access to the updated data with no
further action required.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-09-23" title="Update to minimum accuracy_radius value">
Effective October 4, 2021, the minimum accuracy radius value will be 5km across
our city/postal-level geolocation products and services. Previously, the minimum
accuracy radius value was 1km. This change applies to the following products and
services:

- GeoIP2 City database
- GeoLite2 City database
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
- GeoIP2 Precision City web service
- GeoIP2 Precision Insights web service
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services

We are making this change in order to ensure it is clear that IP geolocation
should not be used to identify a particular street address or household.

<ReleaseNote date="2021-09-08" title="Data Updates for Apple iCloud Private Relay">
We have updated our data in a number of ways in preparation for the rollout of
[iCloud Private Relay](https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay/).
We have worked with Apple to ensure that our data accurately reflects how
Private Relay works and delivers the best possible user experience for your
users.

- Geolocation data across our products and services now incorporate the IP
geolocation feeds published by Apple, which provides coarse city or region
geolocation mappings for iCloud Private Relay IPs.
- We identify iCloud Private Relay IPs in our ISP dataset (present in our
[GeoIP2 ISP](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-isp-database) and
[Enterprise](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/geoip2-enterprise-product-suite/enterprise-database)
databases, and in our [GeoIP2 Precision
Insights](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services) web service)
by tagging ranges as `iCloud Private Relay`.

Apple has shared the following assurances built into Private Relay:

- Geolocation information for clients is validated by the relay servers using
signed tokens, and visible to origins through the IP addresses selected by relay
servers.
   - A user is not able to arbitrarily select their geolocation to evade
   geolocation controls.
- Access to relay servers is rate-limited using device attestation to reduce
fraud.
- All traffic is secured using TLS 1.3.

To ensure your website and servers are ready for Private Relay, database
customers should be sure to update to the latest MaxMind GeoIP2 databases.

In order to get ISP data that includes Private Relay IPs, update to the latest
GeoIP2 ISP or Enterprise database. In order to get geolocation data for Private
Relay IPs, update to the latest GeoIP2 City or Enterprise database.

GeoIP2 Precision Insights customers do not need to take any action to receive
this data. It will be returned in the
[`/traits/isp`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits__isp)
and [`/traits/organization`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits__organization)
outputs.

For more information about Private Relay along with helpful technical
information, visit [Prepare Your Network or Web Server for Private Relay](https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay/)
on Apple’s developer website.

We will continue to monitor these IPs and make any adjustments that are needed
in the future.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-08-31" title="Mapping more mobile networks to a state">
We will be mapping more mobile (cellular) networks to a state (subdivision)
rather than a city for the United States and other countries. This change will
better reflect the end user location of these IP addresses across a region
instead of a specific city.

For example, many of these networks use IP addresses across a region like
“New England.” In such cases, we may map IP addresses to a state in the
geographic center of the region, and set the `accuracy_radius` and
`subdivision_confidence` values appropriately. See our [Support Center
documentation on GeoIP2 accuracy](https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-faq/specifications-and-implementation/how-accurate-is-geoip2/)
for more information about `accuracy_radius` values.

These changes will be implemented incrementally. Some IP addresses will reflect
this change on September 2, 2021, and additional IP addresses will be updated on
September 13, 2021.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-08-18" title="Increased file size of GeoIP2 Country, City, and Enterprise databases, and GeoLite2 Country and City databases">
The file sizes of the GeoIP2 Country, City, and Enterprise databases, and the
GeoLite2 Country and City databases will increase significantly on Friday,
August 20, 2021. The file size increase is due to the activation of a large
number of IPv6 network ranges.

- GeoIP2 Country
  - Binary (MMDB): increase less than 1% to approximately 5.7 MB
  - CSV IPv6 Blocks File: increase less than 1% to approximately 15 MB
- GeoIP2 City
  - Binary (MMDB): increase around 2% to approximately 126 MB
  - CSV IPv6 Blocks File: increase around 8% to approximately 10.8 MB
- GeoIP2 Enterprise
  - Binary (MMDB): increase less than 1% to approximately 364 MB
  - CSV IPv6 Blocks File: increase around 7% to approximately 160 MB

**Update:** The changes in file size were not as significant as initially
forecast. We are working to establish processes that will allow us to provide
better notification about a change in database file size.

We now update GeoIP2 Country, City, ISP, and Enterprise databases (and most of
their legacy equivalents) twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays (instead of
weekly). We made this change so that data corrections and location updates can
be deployed more quickly.

If you would like to take advantage of these more frequent updates, you will
have to update the schedule of your GeoIP2 database downloads. You can find
[documentation on updating your GeoIP2 databases on our developer’s
site](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/updating-databases).

We will be mapping more mobile (cellular) networks to a state (subdivision)
rather than a city for Telstra Internet IPs in Australia, as well as other
mobile networks in France and other countries. This change will better reflect
the traffic distribution of these IP addresses across a state.

These changes will be implemented incrementally. Some IP addresses will reflect
this change on February 2, 2021, and additional IP addresses will be updated on
February 16, 2021.

Germany Business`, or `Vodafone Germany`. Previous values were `Vodafone GmbH`,
`Vodafone Germany`, and `Vodafone DSL`. We are updating these values to more
accurately reflect the type of connection that the IP address is associated
with.

The following GeoIP databases and services are affected by this change:

- GeoIP2 ISP database
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
- GeoIP Legacy ISP and Organization databases
- GeoIP2 Precision and Legacy City Service
