{{< release-note date="2025-01-07" title="Improved geolocation for some networks"}}

On January 10, 2025, we will be releasing an update that will include improved geolocation for some networks. You should expect to see a high volume of small geolocation changes.

Many networks will have new ISO subdivision geolocation information, geolocating networks to a new subdivision that is near the previous subdivision.

These changes are expected and should be an improvement in geolocation accuracy due to improvements in our geocoding algorithm.

The following products and services will be affected:

- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Insights web service
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- minFraud Insights and Factors web services
- GeoLite City database
- GeoLite City web service
