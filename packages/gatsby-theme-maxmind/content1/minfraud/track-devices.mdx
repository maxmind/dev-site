title: Track Devices
---

The Device Tracking Add-On for the minFraud services identifies devices as they
move across networks and enhances the ability of the minFraud services to
detect fraud. If a fraudster changes proxies while they are browsing your
website or between visits to your website, you may observe an increased
risk score in the minFraud output associated with their transactions.

We may increase the risk score if we detect order velocity on the device. We
also return a [device ID](/minfraud/api-documentation/#schema--response--device)
in minFraud Insights and Factors so that you can do your own modeling around
device ID.

## Recommended use

The Device Tracking Add-On is JavaScript code for you to add to your website.
It runs on a visiting device so that the minFraud service can assign a Device
ID and begin collecting fingerprint information. We recommend including the
JavaScript below on your product and landing pages as well as all the pages
within your purchase flow. This will help detect fraudsters if they change or
enable proxies while browsing your website.

To speed page load time, JavaScript should be placed in footer of the HTML
webpage.

Note that, in order to be effective, the Device Tracking Add-on must, at a
minimum, be included on the page where the IP address is captured for a
minFraud query.

## Implementation

Replace `ACCOUNT_ID` with your [MaxMind account ID](https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key).

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  maxmind_user_id = "ACCOUNT_ID";
  (function() {
    var loadDeviceJs = function() {
      var element = document.createElement('script');
      element.src = 'https://device.maxmind.com/js/device.js';
      document.body.appendChild(element);
    };
    if (window.addEventListener) {
      window.addEventListener('load', loadDeviceJs, false);
    } else if (window.attachEvent) {
      window.attachEvent('onload', loadDeviceJs);
    }
  })();
</script>
```

## Cookie and web storage usage

The device tracking add-on uses both a cookie and local storage as one method
of distinguishing unique devices. The add-on sets a cookie with a two-year
expiration for the effective second-level domain of your site; for instance, on
`www.maxmind.com`, the cookie would be set for `maxmind.com`. Both the cookie
and the local storage key are named `__mmapiwsid`.

MaxMind may use other browser storage techniques in the future to enhance the
performance of the device tracking add-on.
