title: GeoIP2 Release Notes - 2019 Archive
---

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-23" title="The USER_ID_REQUIRED error code is now ACCOUNT_ID_REQUIRED">
Our web services, including [GeoIP2 Precision web
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights) and [minFraud
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services), now return
the error code `ACCOUNT_ID_REQUIRED` instead of `USER_ID_REQUIRED` when the
account ID parameter is missing.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-19" title="Resolving to parent city for Australian suburbs">
Effective December 23, 2019, we will begin resolving more Australian IP
addresses to large cities instead of suburbs (e.g. to Sydney instead of
Rushcutters Bay).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-18" title="Changes to accessing and using GeoLite2 databases">
**Free GeoLite2 Database Users:** Due to upcoming data privacy regulations, we
are making significant changes to how you access free GeoLite2 databases
starting December 30, 2019. Learn more on our
[blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-17" title="Query usage report license key filter">
You can now filter by license key when viewing the [query usage
report](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/query-usage-report) \[login
required\] in your account portal.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-10" title="Changes to Japan Postal Codes">
Effective December 16, 2019, we will return `1` as the last digit for all 7
digit postal codes in Japan. The last digit refers to [street-level
resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Japan) and should not
be relied upon for IP geolocation.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-11-08" title="Changes to Portugal Postal Codes">
Effective November 12, 2019, we will return `-001` as the last 3 digits for all
7 digit postal codes in Lisbon, Portugal. Our postal code resolution in
Portugal is accurate for the first 4 digits and we include the `-001` at the
end for backwards compatibility for customers to join the data with 7 digit
Portuguese postal code databases. We may extend this convention to other large
Portuguese cities in the future.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-16" title="Retirement of TLS 1.0/1.1 and unencrypted http minFraud requests">
We retired support for TLS v1.0/v1.1 and unencrypted HTTP requests to minFraud
services today, as part of our commitment to securing and protecting your data.
Please ensure you are using TLS v1.2+ to connect to MaxMind services.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-15" title="New static_ip_score output in web services">
The following output has been added to the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights), and [minFraud
Insights and Factors web
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services):

- `static_ip_score` – An indicator of how static or dynamic an IP address is.
The value ranges from 0 to 99.99 with higher values meaning a greater static
association. For example, many IPs with a `user_type` of `cellular` have a
score under one. Static Cable/DSL IPs typically have a score above thirty.
This indicator can be useful for deciding whether an IP address represents
the same user over time.

The `static_ip_score` output is present in the `traits` object.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-14" title="Final reminder of security-related retirements">
This is a reminder that we are retiring support for requests using TLS 1.0/1.1,
and unencrypted HTTP requests to MaxMind minFraud services on **October 16,
2019**. After October 16, 2019, these types of requests will always fail with
an error. Please update to TLS 1.2+ to avoid service disruption. You may need
to upgrade your technology stack to a later version, or make code changes to do
so.

[Contact us](https://support.maxmind.com/contact-us/) for support or if you
have questions.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-03" title="Improved cellular IP detection">
We have made improvements to how we identify cellular IPs for the
`connection_type` field provided in the [GeoIP2 Connection Type
database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-connection-type-database), and the
`user_type` field provided in the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights) and [minFraud
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services). Accuracy for
cellular identification should now be about 95% accurate globally.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-02" title="Account activity log">
You can now view a log of your MaxMind account activity, which includes a time
stamp, requester, and subject, for the each of the following actions:

- Creation of a new user
- Deactivation of a user
- User password changes
- Email address / username changes

Account administrators can see activity across the whole account, while
non-administrators will only see their own activity. You can find the account
activity log in your account portal under 'Account Information' or
[here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/activity-log) \[login
required\].

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-09-19" title="New network and user_count outputs in web services">
The following outputs have been added to the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights), and [minFraud
Insights and Factors web
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services):

- `network` – The network in [CIDR
notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)
associated with the record. This is the largest network where all of the
fields besides `ip_address` have the same value.
- `user_count` – The estimated number of users sharing the IP/network during
the past 24 hours. For IPv4, the count is for the individual IP. For IPv6,
the count is for the /64 network.

Both of these outputs are present in the `traits` object.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-09-16" title="Planned warning interruption (September 2019)">
**8-hour interruption of old TLS and unencrypted minFraud requests on September
25, 2019**

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-07-15" title="Postal code data for Singapore and South Korea">
We are adding postal code data for Singapore and South Korea. Effective July
22nd 2019, we will return the first 2 digits of Singapore postal codes and
5-digit South Korea postal codes where we have reasonable confidence in postal
resolution.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-07-02" title="Security Tokens">
We've updated the direct download URLs for GeoIP databases in your account
portal to use security tokens instead of license keys. If you are a new user
and wish to use your own script or program to automate GeoIP downloads instead
of using our [GeoIP Update
Program](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate/releases), there are additional
[steps to take](/geoip/updating-databases) after copying the direct download
URL from your account portal.

If you are an existing user that has already set up your own script or program
to automate GeoIP downloads, this change should not affect you, unless you add
new databases to your script or program. Instructions on additional steps are
[here](/geoip/updating-databases).

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-04-18" title="Security-related retirements 2019">
In order to ensure your data is as safe and secure as possible, we will be
retiring support for TLS v1.0 and 1.1, unencrypted HTTP requests to our legacy
minFraud services, and our legacy minFraud SOAP API in the coming months.
Please see our
[blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/04/12/important-updates-about-tls-v1-0-v1-1-unencrypted-http-requests-and-the-legacy-minfraud-soap-api/)
for more info.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-04-08" title="2FA release">
To enhance the security of your MaxMind account, Chrome users can enable
two-factor authentication (2FA). You can now add and require a (FIDO U2F)
security key on top of your account credentials for a more secure log-in. See
our [support center user
guide](https://support.maxmind.com/two-factor-authentication-2fa-user-guide/)
for information on how to set up 2FA.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-01-24" title="Crimea accuracy update 2019">
We completed our most recent review and update of Geolocation for Crimea. Our
accuracy has increased as follows:
Approximately 93% of website visitors who are from Crimea are currently located
by GeoIP as being in Crimea. Approximately 99% of the visitors who are located
in Crimea by GeoIP are actually in Crimea.

We currently locate Crimea in Ukraine, as we use GeoNames data and they locate
Crimea in Ukraine. If GeoNames locates Crimea in Russia in the future, we will
follow their change and post an announcement here as well as on
[https://twitter.com/maxmind](https://twitter.com/maxmind).

In legacy GeoIP, we return a FIPS region code of 11 or 20. In GeoIP2, we return
a iso code of 40 or 43 in the subdivision object.

Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond our
control, we cannot guarantee any specific future accuracy level. Further,
accuracy figures are subject to change as IP networks are reallocated.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-01-23" title="Initial Release of Ruby API">
We have added Ruby as a MaxMind Supported GeoIP2 API
([RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/maxmind-db),
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-ruby)). It provides a
Ruby reader for the MaxMind DB Database Format (used by the GeoIP2 databases
and our free GeoLite2 databases).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-01-14" title="New GeoIP Update released">
We've released a new major version of GeoIP Update. This release adds support
for Windows and has a new code base. You can find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate). We’ve written an [upgrade
guide](/geoip/geoipupdate/upgrading-to-geoip-update-4-x/)
if you’re running an older version.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-01-14" title="Limiting availability of archived GeoIP databases">
In order to address new legal requirements, including the European Union's
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we will be limiting availability of
archived GeoIP databases to 30 days. This change will be effective March 18,
2019 and applies to all GeoIP2, GeoIP, and GeoLite2 databases. You may need to
change your processes or applications to download more recent databases once
this change occurs.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-01-04" title="Server IP Changes January 2019">
On Monday, January 7, 2019 at approximately 15:00 UTC (10:00am EST), we will be
switching to static server IP addresses for traffic to our website and to
downloads.maxmind.com (used for GeoIP database downloads). The IP for the
hostname used by our web services or geoipupdate tool won't change immediately,
but if you whitelist IPs for any of our services we encourage you to add the
new IP addresses to your whitelist. The static IP addresses will be a subset of
what we list on our [MaxMind server IP addresses
page](/maxmind-server-ip-addresses/). We will update the list of IP addresses
on that page following the change. Please sign up for the email list on that
page if you want a notification when our server IP addresses change.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-01-02" title="GeoIP2-node includes support for web service lookups">
We have added web service lookup support to our GeoIP2 Node.js API
([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maxmind/geoip2-node),
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-node)).
</ReleaseNote>
