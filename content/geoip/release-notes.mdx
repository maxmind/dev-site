<ReleaseNote date="2022-2-24" title="Update Regarding IP Geolocations in Ukraine">
IP addresses that are geolocated to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk currently
return Ukraine for the country in MaxMind's products and services.

MaxMind's IP geolocation products and services use GeoNames to determine the
name of the country in which an IP address is located. At this time, we do not
have plans to diverge from GeoNames for IP addresses located in disputed
regions.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2022-02-10" title="GeoNames Monthly Diff Report February 2022">
[GeoNames Monthly Diff Report (February 2022)](/csv-files/GeoNames-Monthly-Diff-Report-February-2022.csv)

GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases incorporate [GeoNames geographical
data](https://www.geonames.org/), which is made available under the [Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Monthly updates to GeoNames data are incorporated into our databases as we
refresh them. Above you will find a CSV report of these changes for the month
of February as they relate to the following fields:

- `geoname_id`
- `country_name`
- `country_code`
- `city_name`
- `subdivision_1_iso_code`
- `subdivision_2_iso_code`

Note that the values for the 'old' and ‘new’ columns for a given field only
differ for the field defined in the ‘diff_in’ column.

\* This month's update has a large number of changes to the GeoNames ID for
locations in China due to some changes in how we process GeoNames data for
China.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2022-02-09" title="Dialup values for connection_type and user_type deprecated">
We have deprecated the dialup values for `connection_type` and `user_type` in
our GeoIP2 products and services:

- GeoIP2 Connection Type database
  - `connection_type` no longer has the possible value of `Dialup`
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
  - `connection_type` no longer has the possible value of `Dialup`
  - `user_type` no longer has the possible value of `dialup`
- GeoIP2 Insights web service
  - `user_type` no longer has the possible value of `dialup`

You can see a list of possible values for the `connection_type` data point in
our [documentation for the GeoIP2 Connection Type
database](/geoip/docs/databases/connection-type?lang=en#blocks-files).

You can see a list of possible values for the `user_type` data point [in the API
schema for our GeoIP2 web
services](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses?lang=en#schema--response--traits__user_type).

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2022-01-25" title="Mobile country and mobile network code data">
We have added data containing the mobile country code and mobile network code to
several of our GeoIP2 product and services. Mobile country code and mobile
network code data uniquely identify mobile network operators (carriers). This
data can be used for carrier segmentation and targeting as well as general
analytics. [Learn more about mobile country code data on
Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code)

This data will be included in the following GeoIP2 products and services:

 - GeoIP2 ISP database
 - GeoIP2 Enterprise database
 - GeoIP2 City Plus web service
 - GeoIP2 Insights web service
 - minFraud Insights web service
 - minFraud Factors web service

### Database users
The `mobile_country_code` and `mobile_network_code` data will be included in all
new releases of the GeoIP2 ISP and Enterprise databases starting with today's
release.

#### CSV file users
The new data columns will be added to the following files:

- GeoIP2 ISP database
  - `GeoIP2-ISP-Blocks-IPv4.csv`
  - `GeoIP2-ISP-Blocks-IPv6.csv`
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
  - `GeoIP2-Enterprise-ISP.csv`

See our developer documentation for the GeoIP2
[ISP](/geoip/docs/databases/isp?lang=en#blocks-files) and
[Enterprise](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise?lang=en#isp-file) databases for
more information about the files. You can also download a sample CSV database
containing the new data columns for GeoIP2
[ISP](/geoip/docs/databases/isp?lang=en#example-files) and
[Enterprise](/geoip/docs/databases/enterprise?lang=en#example-files) from our
developer's site.

#### MMDB file users
You may need to update your [MMDB
reader](/geoip/docs/databases?lang=en#official-api-clients) to support lookups
containing the new output when it is released. You can find a sample MMDB file
with `mobile_country_code` and `mobile_network_code` on our [GitHub
page](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB/tree/master/test-data).

### Web service users
The new data will be included in the `/traits` object:

- [`/traits/mobile_country_code`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses?lang=en#schema--response--traits__mobile_country_code)
- [`/traits/mobile_network_code`](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses?lang=en#schema--response--traits__mobile_network_code)

Our client APIs will be updated in the coming weeks to handle the new data. Make
sure to keep your client API up to date to start taking advantage of this data.

If you are interfacing directly with our REST API, you can begin receiving the
new data right away.

data](https://www.geonames.org/), which is made available under the [Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

<ReleaseNote date="2022-01-10" title="GeoIP2 Precision is now GeoIP2 web service">
We're dropping the "Precision" from our GeoIP2 web service names to make the
closest equivalent between our web services and databases clearer, and to make
it clear that IP geolocation is not precise enough to locate individuals or
street addresses. [You can learn more about the accuracy and limitations to IP
geolocation on our knowledge
base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407630607131-Geolocation-Accuracy)

We are also renaming our city-level geolocation web service to be GeoIP2 City
Plus. We have added "Plus" to this web service to make it clearer that the
city-level geolocation web service also contains IP network data. [You can see a
list of all data points in the GeoIP2 City Plus web service on our main
website.](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-city-service)

Nothing has changed about how to use our web services, and no changes are
required to your current integration.

Our GeoIP2 web services will be renamed as follows:

| Old Name                              | New Name (Click for the Product Page on our Main Website)                                 |
