The following is an example of a complete minFraud Factors response, including
all available outputs. In practice, fewer outputs may be returned based on the
minFraud service you query and the inputs provided.

  <Property
    name="id"
    tags={{
      'Format': 'UUID',
    }}
  >
    This is the minFraud ID, a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
    that identifies the minFraud response. Use this ID to
    [search your minFraud logs](https://www.maxmind.com/en/minfraud-log) or when
    making support requests to MaxMind.
  </Property>

  <Property
    name="risk_score"
    tags={{
      'Format': 'decimal',
      'Min': 0.01,
      'Max': 99,
    }}
  >
    This field contains the risk score, from 0.01 to 99. A higher score
    indicates a higher risk of fraud. For example, a score of 20 indicates a
    20% chance that a transaction is fraudulent. We never return a risk score
    of 0, since all transactions have the possibility of being fraudulent.
    Likewise we never return a risk score of 100.
