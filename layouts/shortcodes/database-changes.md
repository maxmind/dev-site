We may add new data fields to the {{ .Get "product" }} database at any time.

New database fields are added as new columns to the right of existing columns in our CSV files,
and as additional data in our MMDB files.

Subscribe to our [GeoIP release notes](/geoip/release-notes) to be notified when new
data is added to our databases.
