<ReleaseNote date="2024-01-22" title="minFraud no longer accepts event times more than one year in the past">

Starting tomorrow, January 23, 2024, minFraud will no longer accept
`/event/time` inputs with values more than one year in the past. Most customers
do not need to send the `event/time` input and will not be impacted by this
change.
[Learn more about this input and how to use it to score historical transactions on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/5452006111003-Event-and-Account-Inputs#h_01G0Z3WBNAP5Y8WNRR156EJBBF)

If you send the `/event/time` inputs with values more than one year in the past,
minFraud will:

- replace the event time with the current time
- score the transaction and return a score
- return an INPUT_INVALID warning with its response

</ReleaseNote>
