<ReleaseNote date="2014-12-16" title="More IPs mapped to postal codes">
As part of our ongoing work to return more data, MaxMind has increased the
number of IP addresses that map to a postal code.

An ISP may allocate an IP range over multiple postal codes. In such cases,
MaxMind cannot accurately determine the exact postal code associated with an IP
address in that range. Previously we only included a postal code if we were
confident of the resolution. Now, we include more postal codes, returning a
postal code within a 50km radius.

We are doing this as a convenience to our customers who want to use the postal
code instead of the city to link to other data.

In addition, we've added Poland and Portugal to the list of countries for which
we return postal codes. The full list of countries for which we provide postal
codes now includes the following:

Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, India,
Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland,
Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,
United Kingdom, United States.

<ReleaseNote date="2014-11-25" title="Improvements to accuracy in Japan, South Korea and Venezuela and change in lat/lon returned">
We have improved the coverage and accuracy for GeoIP City in Japan, South Korea
and Venezuela. We expect to make further improvements to the accuracy in South
Korea over the next few weeks.

If we are unable to determine the city or region for IP addresses in Argentina,
Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland,
Iran, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden,
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, we will return a latitude and longitude of the
largest city in the country.

<ReleaseNote date="2014-11-19" title="Free JavaScript service discontinued">
We have disabled the free JavaScript GeoIP service.

If you were using the free JavaScript service and wish to continue service, you
must purchase [GeoIP2 Precision
Service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services) queries and
either upgrade to the [GeoIP2 JavaScript
API](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/client-side-javascript) or change the URL called to
that provided by the GeoIP Legacy JavaScript service.

Upgrading to the GeoIP2 JavaScript API comes with several benefits:

- MaxMind’s most accurate IP geolocation data – GeoIP2 Precision data accurately
geolocates 5% more IPs to postal codes and 3% more IPs to cities than GeoIP
Legacy data
- Location names in eight popular languages
- Support for IPv6 addresses
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2014-07-18" title="GeoIP2 JavaScript v2.1">
MaxMind released version 2.1 of our JavaScript API. Changes:

- This release updates the API to use version 2.1 of our GeoIP2 Precision web
service.
- The `omni()` method has been replaced with the `insights()` method.
- The `cityISPOrg()` has been removed.
- The `city()` method now returns ASN, ISP, and organization data.
- As noted in the web service release notes, several fields that were
incorrectly strings in version 2.0 of the web service have been changed to be
numeric.

To upgrade, please use the new JavaScript file specified in our [developer
documentation](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/client-side-javascript).

Users of version 2.0 are not affected, but they are encouraged to update to the
new version. Only serious functionality issues will be fixed in version 2.0.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2014-07-18" title="GeoIP2 Precision Web Service v2.1">
MaxMind has released version 2.1 of the GeoIP2 Precision web service. Changes
include:

- The Omni endpoint was renamed Insights. The path for this endpoint has
changed accordingly.
- The City/ISP/Org endpoint was removed. The City endpoint now returns all of
the data previously returned by City/ISP/Org.
- In v2.0, `accuracy_radius`, `autonomous_system_number`, and all of the
`confidence` values were incorrectly returned as strings. These are now
returned as integers.

To upgrade, please use the updated service URIs specified in our [developer
documentation](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests).

For the version 2.0 endpoints, the City endpoint will now include ISP/Org data.
The other output for the 2.0 endpoints was unchanged.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2014-04-01" title="Type Change to GeoIP2 Metro Code Field">
In previous GeoIP2 databases, the `metro_code` was incorrectly represented as a
string. This has been corrected and now `metro_code` is internally represented
as an `uint16`. This should not affect users of the official Java, .NET, Perl,
or PHP GeoIP2 APIs. The Python API will now return an integer rather than a
string for `metro_code`. Users of libmaxminddb or third-party APIs may be
affected.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2014-01-21" title="Free use of the GeoIP2 JavaScript API has been discontinued">
In order to focus our efforts on providing the best IP data to our customers,
MaxMind has discontinued free use of the GeoIP2 JavaScript API. To continue
using the API, you will need to purchase [GeoIP2 Web
Service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services) lookups.
Individuals unable to purchase services are encouraged to use our free GeoLite2
Country or City databases.
