title: Testing GeoIP Web Services in the MaxMind Sandbox
---

MaxMind maintains a Sandbox environment so that you can test your integration
with the GeoIP web services. In order to set up a Sandbox account you must
already have a paid account, and you must be an account administrator. [Learn
how to set up a Sandbox account on our Knowledge
Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/8604168846363)

Once you have your Sandbox account set up and activated, follow the steps below.

## Generate a license key for your Sandbox account

In order to test the GeoIP web services in the Sandbox environment, you will
need to generate a license key from your Sandbox account. [Learn how to generate a
license key on our Knowledge
Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407111582235-Generate-a-License-Key)
The process is the same for your Sandbox account, but you must login to your
Sandbox account [(direct
link)](https://sandbox.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key) rather than
your regular MaxMind account.

## Build your integration

Consult our [quick start guide](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/web-services?lang=en) or
our [list of client
APIs](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/web-services?lang=en#client-apis) to develop your
integration.

## Point your integration to the Sandbox service endpoints

Use the service endpoints for the Sandbox version of the web services, as listed
in the table below:

| Sandbox Service | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Country         | `GET`       | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/country/{ip_address}`  |
| City Plus       | `GET`       | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/city/{ip_address}`     |
| Insights        | `GET`       | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/insights/{ip_address}` |

Remember to use the license key generated by your Sandbox account to authenticate your requests.

## Test Data for the GeoIP Sandbox

<Alert type="info">
The Sandbox will return geolocation and IP intelligence data, but this data is
not accurate and should not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the minFraud
scoring engine, or for geolocation or IP intelligence. It is designed for
testing purposes only.
</Alert>

There are a limited number of IP addresses in the test database for the GeoIP
web services on the Sandbox. The Sandbox versions of the GeoIP web services use
the same data as our test databases, which are published to Github. [View our
test data on Github.](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB/blob/main/source-data/GeoIP2-Precision-Enterprise-Test.json)

The test data is displayed in JSON format, and would be the expected response
for a query using the listed IP address. [Learn more about working with our
GeoIP test data on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/8610782760731-Sandbox-for-the-GeoIP-Web-Services#h_01GC7FJGRWC116ZCDPAJP09V9M)

## Transaction Request Limits on the Sandbox

The Sandbox environment imposes volume limits on API requests to prevent abuse.
The Sandbox should not be used to test the capacity of the production web service
in high volume situations.

If you are running into the request limit and need help, please [reach out to our
support team for assistance](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses?lang=en#schema--response--warnings).
