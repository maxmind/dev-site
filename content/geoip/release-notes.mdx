<ReleaseNote date="2021-06-08" title="Twice weekly updates for some GeoIP2 databases">
We now update GeoIP2 Country, City, ISP, and Enterprise databases (and most of
their legacy equivalents) twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays (instead of
weekly). We made this change so that data corrections and location updates can
be deployed more quickly.

If you would like to take advantage of these more frequent updates, you will
have to update the schedule of your GeoIP2 database downloads. You can find
[documentation on updating your GeoIP2 databases on our developer’s 
site](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/updating-databases).

<ReleaseNote date="2021-01-29" title="Mapping more Telstra Internet mobile networks to a state">
We will be mapping more mobile (cellular) networks to a state (subdivision)
rather than a city for Telstra Internet IPs in Australia, as well as other
mobile networks in France and other countries. This change will better reflect
the traffic distribution of these IP addresses across a state.

These changes will be implemented incrementally. Some IP addresses will reflect
this change on February 2, 2021, and additional IP addresses will be updated on
February 16, 2021.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2021-01-22" title="Change to Vodafone Germany ISP name">
On Monday, January 25 we will be updating MaxMind products and services with
ISP data to consolidate naming conventions for Vodafone Germany. We will now
return either `Vodafone Germany Cable`, `Vodafone Germany DSL`, `Vodafone
Germany Business`, or `Vodafone Germany`. Previous values were `Vodafone GmbH`,
`Vodafone Germany`, and `Vodafone DSL`. We are updating these values to more
accurately reflect the type of connection that the IP address is associated
with.

The following GeoIP databases and services are affected by this change:

- GeoIP2 ISP database
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
- GeoIP Legacy ISP and Organization databases
- GeoIP2 Precision and Legacy City Service
- GeoIP2 Precision and Legacy Insights Service
- minFraud Insights
- minFraud Factors
