title: GeoIP2 Release Notes - 2015 Archive
---

<ReleaseNote date="2015-11-17" title="libmaxminddb 1.1.2">
MaxMind has released libmaxminddb 1.1.2, which includes a number of important
security fixes. Among these fixes is improved validation of the database
metadata. Unfortunately, MaxMind GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases created earlier
than January 28, 2014, had an invalid data type for the `record_size` in the
metadata. Previously these databases worked on little endian machines with
libmaxminddb but did not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety
checks when reading the file, these databases will no longer work on any
platform. If you are using one of these databases, we recommend that you
upgrade to the latest GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database.

<ReleaseNote date="2015-08-10" title="GeoIP ISP update">
We are updating the GeoIP ISP and Organization databases today to return AT&T
Internet Services instead of BellSouth.net, due to a merger with AT&T. We are
renaming Bouygues Telecom Division Mobile to Bouygues Mobile. There is also a
bug fix to return Frontier Communications instead of AT&T Wireless for Frontier
customers in Connecticut.

<ReleaseNote date="2015-07-13" title="is_anonymous_proxy and is_satellite_provider Deprecation in GeoIP2">
`is_anonymous_proxy` and `is_satellite_provider` are now deprecated in GeoIP2.

Use the [GeoIP2 Anonymous IP
Database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-anonymous-ip-database) to identify
anonymous IPs and refer to the [IP Risk
Score](https://www.maxmind.com/en/explanation-of-minfraud-riskscore) to assess
whether an IP address is high risk.

Due to the increased coverage by mobile carriers, very few satellite providers
now serve multiple countries. As a result, the `is_satellite_provider` output
does not provide sufficiently relevant data for us to maintain it.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2015-06-29" title="Average Income and Population Density">
GeoIP2 Precision Insights service now offers `average_income` and
`population_density` fields within the `location` response. `average_income`
represents the weighted average income in US dollars per person for the zip
code(s) associated with the IP address. `population_density` represents the
weighted population per square kilometer for the zip code(s) associated with
the IP address. Note that these fields are returned for IP addresses located in
the US only. These new fields are documented in the [GeoIP2 Precision Web
Services API
documentation.](/geoip/docs/web-services)

<ReleaseNote date="2015-06-11" title="GeoIP2 CSVs for Anonymous IP, ISP, Domain and Connection Type">
We've released the GeoIP2 Anonymous IP, ISP, Domain and Connection Type
databases in CSV format. All GeoIP2 databases are now available in this format.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2015-05-11" title="Improvements to GeoIP2 Precision City and Insights">
We've enhanced the GeoIP2 Precision City and GeoIP2 Precision Insights services
to identify the organization associated with a business IP address in 10% more
instances.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2015-01-27" title="GeoIP Accuracy in Crimea">
We are working on improving the accuracy in Crimea.

Approximately 60% of website visitors who are from Crimea are currently located
by GeoIP as being in Crimea. We plan to increase this to 75% in the next couple
of months.

Approximately 95% of the visitors who are located in Crimea by GeoIP are
actually in Crimea.

We currently locate Crimea in Ukraine, as we use GeoNames data and they locate
Crimea in Ukraine. If GeoNames locates Crimea in Russia in the future, we will
follow their change and post an announcement here as well as on
https://twitter.com/maxmind

In legacy GeoIP, we return a FIPS region code of 11 or 20. In GeoIP2, we return
a iso code of 40 or 43 in the subdivision object.

Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond our
control, we cannot guarantee any specific future accuracy level. Further,
accuracy figures are subject to change as IP networks are reallocated.
