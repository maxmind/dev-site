title: minFraud Release Notes - 2018 Archive
---

<ReleaseNote date="2018-09-21" title="Changes to US coordinate data">
On Monday, October 1st, we will be changing a large amount of our U.S.
coordinate (latitude & longitude) data\* to use
[GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) coordinates for postal codes. This
change will ensure greater consistency during our build processes. Around 95%
of US coordinates will change with most moving about 1 mile. About 5 to 10% of
US coordinates will move by more than 10 miles.

_\* Coordinate data is approximate and is not precise. It should not be used
to identify a particular street address or household as it refers to a larger
geographical area instead of a precise location._

<ReleaseNote date="2018-07-17" title="New input parameters for use with custom rules">
We have released additional input parameters for use with custom rules.
Customers of minFraud Score, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors can now
use the following inputs to serve as the basis when creating a custom rule:

- IIN: `/credit_card/issuer_id_number` – The issuer ID number for the credit
card. This is the first 6 digits of the credit card number. It identifies
the issuing bank.
- Accept Language: `/device/accept_language` – The HTTP “Accept-Language”
header of the device used in the transaction.
- IP (CIDR block): `/device/ip_address` – A network CIDR block
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2018-05-25" title="New European Union locations added to minFraud Insights and Factors">
Effective May 29, 2018, we will be adding Åland Islands, Martinique, Mayotte,
Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Réunion, and Saint Martin to the list of European
Union locations identified by minFraud Insights and minFraud Factors responses.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2018-05-18" title="Device Tracking Add-on now always uses HTTPS">
The HTTP request made by the Device Tracking Add-on now always uses HTTPS.
Previously it used HTTP if your document was served over HTTP. This reduces
compatibility with certain older versions of Internet Explorer, but will not
cause errors.

We also recommend that you use an HTTPS URL when including the add-on in your
site. We've updated the example code in [our
documentation](/minfraud/track-devices) to show how to do this.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2018-04-10" title="Credit card is_virtual and device local_time outputs, and payout_change event type now available!">
We've added two new output fields to the minFraud Insights and Factors
services. The outputs are:

- Credit card is_virtual: `/credit_card/is_virtual` – A flag that is true if
the credit card is a virtual card.
- Device local_time: `/device/local_time` – A date-time indicating the local
date and time of the transaction in the time zone of the device.

We've also added a new event type to the `/event/type` field for all minFraud
requests: `payout_change`.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2018-02-13" title="EU Country outputs added to minFraud Insights and minFraud Factors services">
We have added additional outputs to the minFraud Insights and minFraud Factors
services. The outputs are:

- EU Country: `/country/is_in_european_union` – Country of the location of the
IP address in an EU member state
- EU Registered Country: `/registered_country/is_in_european_union` – Country
registered by the ISP or organization is an EU member state

minFraud Insights and Factors services now include anonymizer-type outputs.
These outputs are:

- `/ip_address/traits/is_anonymous` – whether the IP address belongs to any
sort of anonymous network.
- `/ip_address/traits/is_anonymous_vpn` – whether the IP address belongs to an
anonymous VPN system.
- `/ip_address/traits/is_hosting_provider` – whether the IP address belongs to
a hosting provider.
- `/ip_address/traits/is_public_proxy` – whether the IP address belongs to a
public proxy.
- `/ip_address/traits/is_tor_exit_node` – whether the IP address is a Tor exit
node.

As these are included via GeoIP2 Precision Insights, please see our [GeoIP2
Precision Web Services documentation](/geoip) for more information.
