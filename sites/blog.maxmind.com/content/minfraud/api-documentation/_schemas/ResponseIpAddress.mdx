  For minFraud Score, this object only contains the `risk` for the IP address.
  For minFraud Insights and Factors, the object is the
  [GeoIP2 Insights response body](/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#geoip2-insights-body-example)
  with four modifications:

  {/* <!--lint disable list-item-bullet-indent --> */}
  1. `risk` has been added directly to the `ip_address` object
  1. `local_time` has been added to the `location` sub-object
  1. The `maxmind` object is not present. See below for descriptions.
  1. minFraud Insights and Factors return the following anonymous IP outputs:
      * `is_anonymous`
      * `is_anonymous_vpn`
      * `is_hosting_provider`
      * `is_public_proxy`
      * `is_residential_proxy`
      * `is_tor_exit_node`
