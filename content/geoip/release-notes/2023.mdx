<ReleaseNote date="2023-12-12" title="December Holiday Database Release Schedule">

Due to the December holidays, we will not be providing database updates for
certain databases on Tuesday, December 26. The following GeoIP and GeoLite
databases will not have their regularly scheduled updates:

- GeoIP Country
- GeoIP City
- GeoIP Connection Type
- GeoIP ISP
- GeoIP Domain Name
- GeoIP Enterprise
- GeoLite Country
- GeoLite City
- GeoLite ASN

The GeoIP Anonymous IP database will continue to update as scheduled.

We will resume our regular update schedule beginning on Friday, December 29.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-12-11" title="Anycast flag available for GeoIP web services and databases">

The Anycast data point is now available in all GeoIP web services and all MMDB
format databases. This includes GeoIP Country, GeoIP City, and GeoIP Enterprise.

For GeoIP web services and databases using the MMDB format, this is a
non-breaking change. However, you may need to update to the latest version of
your API to see the Anycast flag.

For CSV databases (including GeoLite Country and City CSV databases), the
Anycast flag will be released in the first database update after January
17, 2024. In most cases, this should also be a non-breaking change if your
integration can accommodate the addition of new fields. As a best practice, we
recommend checking your integration to confirm.

For more details, including what information the Anycast field will contain,
please
[read our previous release note on the Anycast flag](/geoip/release-notes/2023#anycast-flag-releasing-soon-for-geoip-web-services-and-databases).

Monthly updates to GeoNames data are incorporated into our databases as we
refresh them. Above you will find a CSV report of these changes as they apply to
English place names for the month of December as they relate to the following
fields:

- `geoname_id`
- `country_name`
- `country_code`
- `city_name`
- `subdivision_1_iso_code`
- `subdivision_2_iso_code`

Note that the values for the `old_` and `new_` columns for a given field only
differ for the field defined in the `diff_in` column.

\* In this month's update there are a larger than usual number of changes,
including:

- change of the `country_name` from `Turkey` to `Türkiye`
- a number of Vietnamese locations updated to include non-ASCII characters (for
  example, `Tinh Lam GJong` is now `Lâm Đồng Province`)
- a large number of locations in Brazil and India have updated `geoname_id`s

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-12-08" title="Update to Suddenlink ISP name">

In the Friday, December 8 release of our ISP data, we will be changing the name
of ‘Suddenlink’, an American telecommunications subsidiary of Altice USA, to
‘Optimum’ to reflect Suddenlink’s rebrand to Optimum.

ISP data in the following products and services will be updated:

- GeoIP City Plus and Insights web services
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP ISP database

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-12-07" title="Anycast flag releasing soon for GeoIP web services and databases">

We’re adding a flag to identify Anycast networks in our GeoIP geolocation
databases to help identify instances where we might not provide geolocation for
a particular IP address due to Anycast routing.

Most home and office networks rely on Unicast routing, where every node on the
network is assigned a unique IP address. Anycast routing allows multiple servers
to share the same IP address.

**GeoIP web services**

The Anycast flag will be available in all GeoIP web services by the end of
December. For GeoIP web service users this will be a non-breaking change.

We will post a new release note once the Anycast data point is available.

**GeoIP databases**

The Anycast flag will have a staggered release for GeoIP geolocation database
users. The Anycast flag will be released for MMDB users by the end of December,
at the same that the flag is available in the GeoIP web services. The flag is a
non-breaking change for MMDB format database users.

The Anycast flag will be released in CSV format databases in mid-January, 2023.
In most cases, the addition of a new field to CSV databases should also be a
non-breaking change, but you should check your integration to make sure that it
can accommodate the addition of new fields.

The field will be present in the following GeoIP databases:

- GeoIP Country database
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

**GeoLite databases**

The Anycast field will also be added to the CSV version of GeoLite geolocation
databases, but the new field will be blank. This will allow the GeoIP databases
to continue to be drop in replacements for GeoLite databases, so that it's easy
to upgrade. The field will be present in the following GeoLite databases:

- GeoLite Country database
- GeoLite City database

**Preparing for updated CSV format databases**

MMDB format databases will be able to access the new data through our client
APIs. If you are a CSV user, the following details may be helpful in preparing
your integration for the new data.

- If you're not sure whether you're using the MMDB format, the CSV format, or
  both, you can
  [learn how to check your account's database download history to determine whether you are downloading CSV files on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407114914843)

- The new field will be added to the Blocks CSV files:
  `{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv4.csv` and
  `{GeoIP2,GeoLite2}-{Enterprise,City,Country}-Blocks-IPv6.csv`
- The new field name will be `is_anycast`, will be added to the right of
  existing fields, and the cell will either contain 1 (if the network is an
  Anycast network) or be blank (if it is not). The overwhelming majority of
  networks are not Anycast, and so this field will be blank in most cases.

Please use the following example CSV files to test your integration:

- [GeoIP2-Enterprise-CSV_Example-is_anycast.zip](/static/GeoIP2-Enterprise-CSV_Example-is_anycast.zip)
- [GeoIP2-City-CSV_Example-is_anycast.zip](/static/GeoIP2-City-CSV_Example-is_anycast.zip)
- [GeoIP2-Country-CSV_Example-is_anycast.zip](/static/GeoIP2-Country-CSV_Example-is_anycast.zip)

We have also updated our tutorials on importing GeoIP databases. Please see

when the networks were actually more dynamic.

GeoIP Insights customers will see the static IP score for cellular IPv6
addresses reduce.

[Learn more about static IP scores in GeoIP on our Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408208479131-User-Context-Data#h_01FN9BSX7X351J8PV0WCH0E88F)

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-11-15" title="Special release of our geolocation databases">

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2023-10-17" title="Cloudflare WARP will be identified as a consumer privacy network">
Beginning Friday, October 20, Cloudflare WARP will be identified as a consumer
privacy network in our data.

Consumer privacy networks are VPNs managed by tech companies. Access to these
networks is tied to a user account that is usually tied to other products and
services more closely associated with the consumer's real identity. These
networks are not necessarily used for the kinds of malicious activity that VPNs,
residential proxies, and other anonymizing networks are used for.

Consumer privacy networks are identified in our user type data with the value
`consumer_privacy_network`, and can be identified by name in our ISP data. This
data can be accessed in the following MaxMind products and services:

**User Type Data:**

- GeoIP Insights web service
- GeoIP Enterprise database

**ISP Data:**

- GeoIP Insights web service
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP ISP database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

<ReleaseNote date="2023-08-28" title="New Satellite connection type releasing">

Effective Tuesday August 29, 2023 we will be adding a new connection type value,
`Satellite`, which will identify satellite internet providers such as Starlink,
Viasat, and Hughes. Satellite connections typically have higher latency than
cable/DSL connections.

The `Satellite` connection type value will appear in the following databases:

- GeoIP Connection Type database
- GeoIP Enterprise database

Users of the following client APIs will need to update their API to the latest
version to avoid breaking changes with the new value:

- [Update Java API to version 4.1.0](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.maxmind.geoip2/geoip2)

<ReleaseNote date="2023-08-17" title="API policies - temporary enforcement on October 17, 2023">

To improve our server infrastructure and allow for better performance and
efficiency, MaxMind will begin enforcing our policies around our API and
database download requests in March 2024. To help customers get ready for this
change, we will have a planned, temporary enforcement of these policies on
October 17, 2023.

**What are the policies?**

- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests sent with the more
  secure HTTPS protocol.
- MaxMind will only accept API and database download requests that are sent to
  the appropriate hostname as documented in the integration instructions on our
  Developer Portal (see direct links below).

**What do I need to do?** If you download GeoIP or GeoLite databases and you use
an up to date version of
[our `geoipupdate` program](/geoip/updating-databases#using-geoip-update), you
do not need to take any action.

If you are using web services, or if you do direct downloads of GeoIP or GeoLite
databases, you should ensure that you are using the correct hostname for your
API requests, and that you are using HTTPS, prior to October 17, 2023. You can
view the appropriate URIs for GeoIP and GeoLite services and downloads on our
Developer Portal using the links below:

- [GeoIP Country, City Plus, and Insights web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geoip2-endpoints)
- [GeoIP and GeoLite database downloads](/geoip/updating-databases/#directly-downloading-databases)
- [GeoIP Legacy web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/legacy#per-service-uris)
- [GeoLite web services](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints)

**Please note:** This enforcement will also effect minFraud API requests. If you
are also a minFraud user, see
[our minFraud release note on this issue.](/minfraud/release-notes/2023#api-policies---temporary-enforcement-on-october-17-2023)

- Beginning on March 27, 2023, we will no longer be issuing unhashed license
  keys for use with legacy versions of
  [our GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases) (any version prior to
  v3.1.1).

**For customers using our REST API, Client APIs or version 3.1.1 and higher of
[our GeoIP Update program](/geoip/updating-databases):**

No action is required. Existing license keys will still be valid and will
continue to function normally.

New license keys will have the following changes:

- The character set is changing from `[a-zA-Z0-9]` to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
- The length of the license key will now be 40 characters.
- License keys will have a `_mmk` suffix.

Please note that the length of license keys may be increased in the future.

**Customers using legacy versions of our GeoIP Update program:**

Legacy versions of `geoipupdate` use less secure unhashed license keys.
Beginning on March 27, 2023 we will no longer be issuing new unhashed license
keys. Your existing license keys can continue to be used, but you will no longer
be able to generate new unhashed license keys.

New license keys only work with geoipupdate version 3.1.1 or greater. We
encourage you to update to the latest version at your earliest convenience.

<ReleaseNote date="2023-01-23" title="Change to AT&T ISP name">
On Monday, February 6 we will be updating MaxMind products and services with
ISP data to consolidate naming conventions for certain AT&T ISP names. We will
now return `AT&T Internet` instead of `AT&T Internet Services` and `AT&T
U-verse`. We are updating these values to more accurately reflect new brand name
used by AT&T.
