<ReleaseNote date="2023-01-23" title="Change to AT&T ISP name">
On Monday, February 6 we will be updating MaxMind products and services with
ISP data to consolidate naming conventions for certain AT&T ISP names. We will
now return `AT&T Internet` instead of `AT&T Internet Services` and `AT&T
U-verse`. We are updating these values to more accurately reflect new brand name
used by AT&T.

The following databases and services are affected by this change:

- GeoIP2 ISP database
- GeoIP2 Enterprise database
- GeoIP Legacy ISP and Organization databases
- GeoIP2 City Plus and Legacy City Web Service
- GeoIP2 and Legacy Insights Web Service
- minFraud Insights
- minFraud Factors
