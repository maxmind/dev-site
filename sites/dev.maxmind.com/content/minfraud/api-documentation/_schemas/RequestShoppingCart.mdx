  This is an _array_ of [shopping cart item objects](#schema--request--shopping-cart--item).
  A shopping cart should consist of an array of one or more item objects.

  For instance, the response for Oxford in the United Kingdom would have an
  object for England as the first element in `subdivisions` array and an object
  for Oxfordshire as the second element. The `subdivisions` array for
  Minneapolis in the United States will have a single object for Minnesota.
