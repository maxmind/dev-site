## Authorization and Security

The HTTP `Authorization` header is required for authorization. The username is
your [MaxMind account ID](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).
The password is your [MaxMind license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key).

<Alert type="warning">
  You must be approved for a trial or purchase credit for use with our web
  services in order to receive an account ID and license key.
</Alert>

We use [basic HTTP authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
The APIs which require authentication are only available via HTTPS. The
credentials are never transmitted unencrypted. If you attempt to access this
service via HTTP, you will receive a `403 Forbidden` HTTP response.

We require TLS 1.2 or greater for all requests to our servers to keep your data
secure.

## Service Endpoints

The endpoint for each service is as specified below.

| Service  | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                              |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Score    | `POST`      | `https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/score`    |
| Insights | `POST`      | `https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/insights` |
| Factors  | `POST`      | `https://minfraud.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/factors`  |

The **minfraud.maxmind.com** hostname automatically picks the data center
geographically closest to you.

## Headers

The `Authorization` header is always required. See 
[Authorization and Security](#authorization-and-security) for more details.

The `Accept` header for a request is entirely optional. If you do include one,
you must accept one of the following, substituting the `[SERVICE-TYPE]` with 
either `score`, `insights`, or `factors` as appropriate:

* `application/json`
* `application/vnd.maxmind.com-minfraud-[SERVICE TYPE]+json`
* `application/vnd.maxmind.com-minfraud-[SERVICE TYPE]+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`
 
 A request for any other MIME type will result in a 
 `415 Unsupported Media Type` error.

If you set the `Accept-Charset` header in your client code, you must accept the 
`UTF-8` character set. If you don't you will receive a `406 Not Acceptable` 
response.

## Bodies
minFraud Score, Factors and Insights share the same request body format. Below
is a full example of the JSON body document. For detailed explainations of each
property within the request body, please refer to the
