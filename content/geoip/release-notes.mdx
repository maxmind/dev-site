[GeoNames Monthly Diff Report (January 2022)](/csv-files/GeoNames-Monthly-Diff-Report-January-2022.csv)

GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases incorporate [GeoNames geographical
data](https://www.geonames.org/), which is made available under the [Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Monthly updates to GeoNames data are incorporated into our databases as we
refresh them. Above you will find a CSV report of these changes for the month
of January as they relate to the following fields:

- `geoname_id`
- `country_name`
- `country_code`
- `city_name`
- `subdivision_1_iso_code`
- `subdivision_2_iso_code`

Note that the values for the 'old' and ‘new’ columns for a given field only
differ for the field defined in the ‘diff_in’ column.

<ReleaseNote date="2022-01-10" title="GeoIP2 Precision is now GeoIP2 web service">
We're dropping the "Precision" from our GeoIP2 web service names to make the
closest equivalent between our web services and databases clearer, and to make
it clear that IP geolocation is not precise enough to locate individuals or
street addresses. [You can learn more about the accuracy and limitations to IP
geolocation on our knowledge
base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407630607131-Geolocation-Accuracy)

We are also renaming our city-level geolocation web service to be GeoIP2 City
Plus. We have added "Plus" to this web service to make it clearer that the
city-level geolocation web service also contains IP network data. [You can see a
list of all data points in the GeoIP2 City Plus web service on our main
website.](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-city-service)

Nothing has changed about how to use our web services, and no changes are
required to your current integration.

Our GeoIP2 web services will be renamed as follows:

| Old Name                              | New Name (Click for the Product Page on our Main Website)                                 |
