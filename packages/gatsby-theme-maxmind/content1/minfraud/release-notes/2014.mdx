title: minFraud Release Notes - 2014 Archive

<ReleaseNote date="2014-08-04" title="WSDL and Port Change Required for Some minFraud SOAP Users">
On August 11, we will discontinue serving requests to port 8005. Users of WSDL
version 2 and 4 must take action to ensure continuation of service. We ask
that you upgrade your WSDL:

- To access the latest inputs and outputs, we recommend you upgrade to our
latest WDSL and upgrade to minfraud version 1.3. Note that the old score and
explanation outputs are no longer supported in the latest WDSL.
- If your system requires score and explanation for backwards compatibility,
you may upgrade to WSDL version 5.

In addition, on August 5, we will disable the web services on port 8005 for
one hour starting at 1pm UTC.

Please email us at support@maxmind.com if you have any questions.
