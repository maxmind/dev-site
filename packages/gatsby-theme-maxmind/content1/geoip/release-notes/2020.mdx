<ReleaseNote date="2020-12-30" title="United Kingdom will no longer be flagged is_in_european_union">
Effective January 5, 2021, the `is_in_european_union` flag will no longer be
marked true for locations in the United Kingdom. This change will be reflected
in the data in GeoLite2 databases and web services, GeoIP2 databases, GeoIP2
Precision web services, and minFraud Insights and Factors services.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-12-15" title="GeoLite2 web service released">
We have released a free IP geolocation API, which allows users to query our
GeoLite2 data. See our blog for [an overview of the GeoLite2 web
service](https://blog.maxmind.com/2020/12/15/geolite2-web-service-free-ip-geolocation-api/).
You can learn how to integrate the GeoLite2 web service in our [Getting Started
with GeoLite2
guide](https://support.maxmind.com/getting-started-with-geolite2/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-12-14" title="Notifications for database update delays">
We now provide direct notifications in the rare event of a database update
delay (past 11:59 PM EST on Tuesdays) on our [service status
page](https://status.maxmind.com/). You can subscribe to these updates by
email, webhook, or RSS. To subscribe, click the button in the upper right of
the page. After subscribing to updates, select 'Manage Existing Subscription'
to manage which services you receive updates for. You can deselect services and
servers which are not relevant to you, though you should ensure ‘New Database

<ReleaseNote date="2020-10-20" title="New Data Point is_residential_proxy Released for GeoIP2 Anonymous IP">
We have released an additional data point for the [GeoIP2 Anonymous IP
Database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/geoip2-enterprise-product-suite/anonymous-ip-database).
Subscribers can now identify whether an IP address is likely a [residential
proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Residential_proxy):

- is_residential \_proxy – 1 if the IP address is on a suspected anonymizing
network and belongs to a residential ISP. Blank if not.

**CSV file users:**
A new data column will be added to the end of the following files:

- GeoIP2-Anonymous-IP-Blocks-IPv4.csv
- GeoIP2-Anonymous-IP-Blocks-IPv6.csv

**Binary MMDB file users:**
You will need to update your [MMDB
reader](/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/databases/#official-maxmind-api-clients)
to support look-ups containing the new output when it is released.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-10-20" title="New Output is_residential_proxy Released for GeoIP2 Precision Insights Web Service, minFraud Insights, and minFraud Factors">

Insights](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services), [minFraud
Insights, and minFraud
Factors](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services) customers can
now see whether an IP address is likely a [residential
proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Residential_proxy):

- /traits/is_residential_proxy – This is true if the IP address is on a
suspected anonymizing network and belongs to a residential ISP. Otherwise,
the key is not included in the traits object.

Our [client
APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction/#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) have been
updated to support these outputs so may need to refresh yours if you are not
interfacing directly with our REST API.

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-02-27" title="GeoIP2 Ruby API supports web service lookups">
We have added support for web service lookups to the MaxMind Supported Ruby API
([RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/maxmind-geoip2),
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-ruby)).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-02-18" title="mmdbinspect beta release">
We've released [mmdbinspect](https://github.com/maxmind/mmdbinspect), in beta,
which gives GeoIP2 users an easier way to interface with multiple
[MMDB](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/) files. The [mmdbinspect
tool](https://github.com/maxmind/mmdbinspect) is a command-line interface built
with Go, which allows a user to look up one or more IPs from one or more MMDB
databases and receive the output in a parsable JSON format.

“Do Not Sell” or opt-out of sale requests in accordance with the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). You may view this list, along with more

Effective January 21, 2020, many records for the
`autonomous_system_organization` data field in GeoIP2 databases and web
services will change from full ISP names to abbreviated codes, due to changes
in a third-party data feed that contributes to building this data. We recommend
using the `isp` and `organization` data fields as they should be more stable
over time and reflect the full ISP brand name.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2020-01-06" title="Flagging more networks used by businesses as 'corporate'">
Effective January 20, 2020, we will be flagging more Cable/DSL networks used by
businesses (i.e. IP networks from ISPs that serve mid-small sized businesses)
as `Corporate` in the [GeoIP2 Connection Type
database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-connection-type-database).
Previously these types of networks were more often flagged as `Cable/DSL`.
