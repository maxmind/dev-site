import * as geoipResponseJson from './_examples/geoip';

## Headers

The `Content-Type` for a successful response varies based on the service as
outlined below:

| Service          | Content-Type                                                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GeoIP2 Country   | `application/vnd.maxmind.com-country+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.1`  |
| GeoIP2 City      | `application/vnd.maxmind.com-city+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.1`     |
| GeoIP2 Insights  | `application/vnd.maxmind.com-insights+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.1` |
| GeoLite2 Country | `application/vnd.maxmind.com-country+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.1`  |
| GeoLite2 City    | `application/vnd.maxmind.com-city+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.1`     |

Errors may be returned with the `Content-Type` set to
`application/vnd.maxmind.com-error+json; charset=UTF-8; version=2.0`. If this
is the case, then the body of the response contains a JSON document with two
keys, `code` and `error`. See the [Errors](#errors) section for more details.

The response will always include a `Content-Length` header as well.

## Bodies

Each service returns data as a JSON document. The document that is returned
always consists of an object (aka map or hash). Below are the schema definitions
that describe each service's response body.

### GeoIP2 Country Body Example

The following is an example of a full response to a GeoIP2 Precision Country
request.

A GeoLite2 Country request follow the same structure, but the data returned
will be less accurate. In addition, GeoLite Country requests will not return
the `maxmind` object.

<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(geoipResponseJson.country, null, 2)}
</Example>

### GeoIP2 City Body Example

The following is an example of a full response to a GeoIP2 Precision City
request.

A GeoLite2 City request follow the same structure, but the data returned will
be less accurate. In addition, GeoLite2 City requests will not return the
`domain`, `isp`, or `organization` values in the `traits` object, and it will
not return the `maxmind` object.

<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(geoipResponseJson.city, null, 2)}
</Example>

### GeoIP2 Insights Body Example

The following is an example of a full response to a GeoIP2 Precision City
request.

<Example language="json">
  {JSON.stringify(geoipResponseJson.insights, null, 2)}
</Example>

## Errors

When the server returns an error (`4xx` or `5xx`), the response may include a
JSON document in the body. This document is a single object with the keys `code`
and `error`. The `code` field is a static error code for machine use. The value
of any given code will never change, though codes can be added or removed. The
`error` field is a human-readable description of the error and may change at any
time.

Not all errors include a JSON body. An error in content negotiation will not
include a body, nor will many `5xx` errors, which typically happen outside of
our web service request handling code. You should check the `Content-Type` type
of an error response before attempting to decode the body as JSON.

In addition to the errors documented below, client code should also be prepared
to handle any valid HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` status code.

## Object Reference

Each schema definition contains a description of an object, along with a list of
properties that belong to the object. The following information is listed for
each object property:

  {/* <!-- lint disable list-item-bullet-indent --> */}
  * name
  * type (`array<type>`, `boolean`, `number`, `integer`, `object`, `string`)
  * description
  * example
  * formatting
  * constraints
  * supported services (`Country`, `City`, `Insights`)
  {/* <!-- lint enable list-item-bullet-indent --> */}

Additionally, for `object` properties, a link is provided to view a schema
definition that further describes that specific object.

<Schemas.Response />
<Schemas.ResponseCity />
<Schemas.ResponseContinent />
<Schemas.ResponseCountry />
<Schemas.ResponseLocation />
<Schemas.ResponsePostal />
<Schemas.ResponseRegisteredCountry />
<Schemas.ResponseRepresentedCountry />
<Schemas.ResponseSubdivisions />
<Schemas.ResponseSubdivision />
<Schemas.ResponseTraits />
<Schemas.ResponseMaxMind />

## Miscellaneous Notes

### Languages
Many of the objects listed above include a `names` key. The value of that key is
in turn an object which maps locale codes to a name in the appropriate language
and script.

Currently, this web service may return the following locale codes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Language</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>de</td>
      <td>German</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>en</td>
      <td>English</td>
      <td>
        English names may still include accented characters if that is the
        accepted spelling in English. In other words, English does not mean
        ASCII.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>es</td>
      <td>Spanish</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fr</td>
      <td>French</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ja</td>
      <td>Japanese</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pt-BR</td>
      <td>Brazilian Portuguese</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ru</td>
      <td>Russian</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>zh-CN</td>
      <td>Chinese (Simplified)</td>
      <td>{' '}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If an object has any name data, then `en` will be one of the keys in the `names`
object. No other language is guaranteed. However, it is possible that we might
not have any name data at all for a given object.

### Returned Values as Database, Map, Dict, or Hash Keys

<Alert type="warning">
  We strongly discourage you from using a value from any `names` field as a key
  in a database or map/dict/hash data structure.
</Alert>

These names may change between releases. Instead we recommend using one of the
following:

| Data object                                                | Recommended key            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `city`                                                     | `geoname_id`               |
| `continent`                                                | `code` or `geoname_id`     |
| `country`, `registered_country`, and `represented_country` | `iso_code` or `geoname_id` |
| `postal`                                                   | `code`                     |
| `subdivisions`                                             | `iso_code` or `geoname_id` |
