<ReleaseNote date="2021-05-19" title="Updated warning codes in minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors">
We updated warning codes for [minFraud Score, Insights and Factors](/minfraud)
responses in the [/warnings/
object](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--warnings).

* We added `BILLING_REGION_NOT_FOUND` and `SHIPPING_REGION_NOT_FOUND` codes
* We updated the warning explanations for certain warning codes to include that
distance calculations (outlined below) may be impacted when certain location
information is missing or cannot be found
    - `/shipping_address/distance_to_ip_location`
    - `/shipping_address/distance_to_billing_address`
    - `/billing_address/distance_to_ip_location`

See our developer documentation for the [updated codes and
warnings](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--warnings).

<ReleaseNote date="2021-05-13" title="Updates to minFraud Alerts">
We recently made some updates to minFraud alerts, which notifies minFraud users
about previously low-risk transactions that are now high-risk due to updated
information. Learn more [on our
blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2021/05/12/what-are-minfraud-alerts-and-what-do-i-do-with-them/).

<ReleaseNote date="2021-02-22" title="Normalize Emails Before Hashing for Improved minFraud Scoring">
The client APIs for minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors now normalize emails
prior to hashing them for improved risk scoring. Email normalization ensures
that minor, inconsequential differences in the email input (i.e.,
`jadoeisonline@yahoo.com` and `jadoeisonline-12345@yahoo.com`) do not result in
minFraud treating these as different email addresses.

Our [client
APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) for
minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors have been updated to support email
normalization so you may need to refresh yours in order to get automatic email
normalization. If you interface directly with our REST API or use minFraud
Legacy, we recommend that you normalize email addresses prior to hashing.
Please see our developer’s site for [guidance on how to normalize
emails](/minfraud/normalizing-email-addresses-for-minfraud).

<ReleaseNote date="2021-02-03" title="New output IP risk reasons">
The `ip_address/risk_reasons` output is now available. [minFraud
Insights](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services) and [minFraud
Factors](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services/minfraud-factors)
customers can now see reason codes associated with the IP risk score for high
risk IP addresses. When the IP risk score is high, the field may be populated
with one or more of the following reason codes:

* `ANONYMOUS_IP` – The IP address belongs to an anonymous network. See
`/ip_address/traits` for more information.
* `HIGH_RISK_DEVICE` – A high risk device was seen on this IP address in your
past transactions.
* `HIGH_RISK_EMAIL` – A high risk email address was seen on this IP address in
your past transactions.
* `BILLING_POSTAL_VELOCITY` – Many different billing postal codes have been
seen on this IP address in your past transactions.
* `EMAIL_VELOCITY` – Many different email addresses have been seen on this IP
address in your past transactions.
* `ISSUER_ID_NUMBER_VELOCITY` – Many different issuer ID numbers have been seen
on this IP address in your past transactions.
* `MINFRAUD_NETWORK_ACTIVITY` – Suspicious activity has been seen on this IP
address across minFraud customers.

If the IP risk score is low, the `risk_reasons` field will be blank. Our
[client APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis)
have been updated to support this output so you may need to refresh yours in
order to see the new output if you are not interfacing directly with our REST
API.

<ReleaseNote date="2021-01-22" title="Change to Vodafone Germany ISP name">
On Monday, January 25 we will be updating MaxMind products and services with
ISP data to consolidate naming conventions for Vodafone Germany. We will now
return either `Vodafone Germany Cable`, `Vodafone Germany DSL`, `Vodafone
Germany Business`, or `Vodafone Germany`. Previous values were `Vodafone GmbH`,
`Vodafone Germany`, and `Vodafone DSL`. We are updating these values to more
accurately reflect the type of connection that the IP address is associated
with.
