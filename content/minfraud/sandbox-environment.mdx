## Generate a License Key for the Sandbox

<SandboxLicenseKey />

## Build your integration

Consult our [quick start guide](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction) or our
[list of client APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis)
to develop your integration.

## Point your integration to the Sandbox service endpoints

Use the service endpoints for the Sandbox version of the web services, as listed
in the table below:

| Sandbox Service | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                             |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Score           | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/score`    |
| Insights        | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/insights` |
| Factors         | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/factors`  |

Remember to use the license key generated by your Sandbox account to
authenticate your requests.

## Test data for the Sandbox minFraud service

<Alert type="info">
The Sandbox will return risk scores and risk data, but this data is not
accurate and should not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the minFraud
scoring engine, or for geolocation or IP intelligence. It is designed
for testing purposes only.
</Alert>

You may only submit approved test data to the Sandbox version of the minFraud
services. At this time, the only approved test transaction data are the three IP
addresses listed below. You can submit transactions to Sandbox minFraud services
with any of the following IP addresses as the
[`/device/ip_address`](/minfraud/api-documentation/requests#schema--request--device__ip_address)
input. You should receive a minFraud response with risk scores. The IP risk
score output
([`/ip_address/risk`](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses#schema--response--ip-address__risk))
will contain a response within the range defined below:

| Test IP Address Input | Test IP Risk Score Output Range |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `128.101.101.101`     | 40 - 99                         |
| `74.209.24.1`         | 5 - 39.99                       |
| `65.116.3.80`         | 0.01 - 4.99                     |

Please note that the Sandbox environment may not return all the risk data that
the minFraud service would return, and the risk scores and risk data it does
return will not be accurate. The Sandbox environment should be used for basic
integration testing, to confirm that you are passing inputs in a valid format
and that you are able to process the basic format of minFraud responses.

[Learn more on our Knowledge Base about the kinds of outputs you can expect to receive from real minFraud transactions.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407964824859-Pass-Inputs-to-minFraud#h_01GD1EDANJCXFHBD9TT8TXA615)

You should not submit real transaction data to the Sandbox version of the
minFraud services, but you can submit transactions with dummy data.

## Test Legacy versions of minFraud using the Sandbox

If you are a minFraud Legacy user, you can test Legacy versions of the minFraud
services your Sandbox account.
