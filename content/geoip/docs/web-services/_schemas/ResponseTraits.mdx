    An indicator of how static or dynamic an IP address is. The value ranges
    from 0 to 99.99 with higher values meaning a greater static association. For
    example, many IP addresses with a `user_type` of `cellular` have a score
    under one. Broadband IPs that don’t change very often typically have a score
    above thirty.

    This indicator can be useful for deciding whether an IP address represents
    the same user over time.
