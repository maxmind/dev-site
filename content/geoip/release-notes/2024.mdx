GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases incorporate
[GeoNames geographical data](https://www.geonames.org/), which is made available

Monthly updates to GeoNames data are incorporated into our databases as we
refresh them. Above you will find a CSV report of these changes as they apply to
English place names for the month of January as they relate to the following
fields:

- `geoname_id`
- `country_name`
- `country_code`
- `city_name`
- `subdivision_1_iso_code`
- `subdivision_2_iso_code`

Note that the values for the `old_` and `new_` columns for a given field only
differ for the field defined in the `diff_in` column.

\* In this month's update a large number of cities in Argentina have improved
place names.
