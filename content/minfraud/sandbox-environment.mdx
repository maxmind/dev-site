title: Testing minFraud in the MaxMind Sandbox
---

MaxMind maintains a Sandbox environment so that you can do basic integration
tests with the minFraud services. In order to set up a Sandbox account you must
already have a paid account, and you must be an account administrator. [Learn
how to set up a Sandbox account on our Knowledge
Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/8604168846363)

Once you have your Sandbox account set up and activated, follow the steps below.

## Generate a license key for your Sandbox account

In order to test the minFraud services in the Sandbox environment, you will need
to generate a license key from your Sandbox account. [Learn how to generate a
license key on our Knowledge
Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407111582235-Generate-a-License-Key)
The process is the same for your Sandbox account, but you must login to your
Sandbox account [(direct
link)](https://sandbox.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key) rather than
your regular MaxMind account.

## Build your integration

Consult our [quick start guide](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction?lang=en) or our
[list of client
APIs](/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction?lang=en#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) to
develop your integration.

## Point your integration to the Sandbox service endpoints

Use the service endpoints for the Sandbox version of the web services, as
listed in the table below:

| Sandbox Service | HTTP Method | Endpoint                                             |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Score           | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/score`    |
| Insights        | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/insights` |
| Factors         | `POST`      | `https://sandbox.maxmind.com/minfraud/v2.0/factors`  |

Remember to use the license key generated by your Sandbox account to
authenticate your requests.

## Test data for the Sandbox minFraud service

<Alert type="info">
The Sandbox will return risk scores and risk data, but this data is not
accurate and should not be used to evaluate the efficacy of the minFraud
scoring engine, or for geolocation or IP intelligence. It is designed
for testing purposes only.
</Alert>

You may only submit approved test data to the Sandbox version of the minFraud
services. At this time, the only approved test transaction data are the three IP
addresses listed below. You can submit transactions to Sandbox minFraud services
with any of the following IP addresses as the [`/device/ip_address`](/minfraud/api-documentation/requests?lang=en#schema--request--device__ip_address)
input. You should recieve a minFraud response with risk scores and risk data.
The IP risk score output ([`/ip_address/risk`](/minfraud/api-documentation/responses?lang=en#schema--response--ip-address__risk))
will contain the expected response below.

| Test IP Address Input | Test IP Risk Score Output |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `146.243.121.22`      | 75                        |
| `152.216.7.110`       | 0.01                      |
| `23.10.87.103`        | 0.01                      |

You should not submit real transaction data to the Sandbox version of the
minFraud services, but you can submit transactions with dummy data.

## Test Legacy versions of minFraud using the Sandbox

You can control which version of the minFraud services your Sandbox account
simulates so that you can test your integrations with various versions. This may
help with upgrading from minFraud Legacy.

Knowledge Base.](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/8609986461083#h_01GC79RT2Y24K8YGB7AH0EP9N9)
