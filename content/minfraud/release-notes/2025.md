{{< release-note date="2025-12-18" title="New email domain outputs in the Insights and Factors web services">}}

We have added new fields to the [`email/domain` sub-object](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#email--domain) in our minFraud Insights and Factors web services. This enhancement provides you with more granular data for risk modeling and workflows, which is especially useful in B2B account opening/onboarding use cases.

These data points will only be returned when you pass the domain or the unhashed email address as an input to the minFraud Insights and Factors web services. [Learn more about domain risk data on our knowledge base.](https://support.maxmind.com/knowledge-base/minfraud-domain-risk-data)

| new output | description |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `email/domain/classification`                       | A classification of the domain such as business or education. [Read the API specifications for domain classification on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--email--domain__classification) | 
| `email/domain/risk`                | Contains the risk associated with the domain. [Read the API specifications for domain risk on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--email--domain__risk) |
| `email/domain/volume`                | Indicates how much activity we see on an email domain across the minFraud network, expressed in sightings per million. [Read the API specifications for domain volume on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#schema--response--email--domain__volume) |
| `email/domain/first_seen`                | When an email domain was first seen on the minFraud Network. [Read the API specifications for domain tenure tracking on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses#schema--response--email--domain__first_seen) |
| `email/domain/visit`                | A sub-object of `email/domain` that contains information about an automated visit to the email domain such as whether a website on the domain is live. [Read the API specifications for domain visit on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/responses/#email--domain--visit) |

[Client APIs](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) have been updated to reflect this change.

{{< release-note date="2025-12-18" title="Expanded event type inputs, and new payment method and event party inputs">}}

We have released additional inputs and possible input values for all minFraud web service customers. 

| new input | description |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `payment/method`                       | The payment method associated with the transaction. [View possible values on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/requests/#schema--request--payment__method) | 
| `event/party`                | The party submitting the transaction. Either `agent` or `customer`. This input can help reduce false positive potential in cases where an agent is submitting transactions on behalf of customers. [Learn more on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/requests/#schema--request--event__party) |

`event/type` now supports the additional values below. [View the full list of possible values for `event/type` on our developer portal.](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/api-documentation/requests/#schema--request--event__type)

| additional input | description |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `credit_application`                       | The transactor is attempting to submit an application for credit.| 
| `fund_transfer`                | The transactor is attempting to transfer funds from one account to another. |
| `sim_swap`                | For mobile network operators. A new SIM card or eSIM is being issued to activate service on a customer’s existing phone number. |

Passing the additional inputs above can help us improve our risk scoring accuracy for you by increasing the context available to our machine learning models and heuristics.

Our [client APIs](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/evaluate-a-transaction#links-to-maxmind-client-apis) have been updated to support these inputs so you may need to refresh yours to submit them in your minFraud requests if you are not interfacing directly with our REST API.

{{< release-note date="2025-12-17" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in additional countries">}}

Effective tomorrow, Thursday, December 18, 2025, we will be blanking out the subdivision, city, and postal fields more often in the following countries. This change will result in fewer resolutions in: 

- Amman, Jordan
- Budapest, Hungary
- Reykjavik, Iceland
- All cities in Austria
- All cities in South Africa
- All cities in Vietnam

We will also be blanking out city and postal fields more often for cell networks in: 
- India
- Mexico
- United States

This change is to reduce false positives when the end users of a network are dispersed all over the country.

The update will be reflected in the following products and services:

- minFraud Factors web service
- minFraud Insights web service
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service

{{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-11-28" title="Subdivision, city, and postal fields blanked in additional countries">}}

Effective Monday, December 1, 2025, we will be blanking out the subdivision, city, and postal fields more often in the following countries. This change will result in fewer resolutions in: 

- Belgium
- Israel
- Italy
- The Netherlands
- Portugal
- Sweden
- Ukraine

We will also be blanking out city and postal fields more often for cell networks in: 
- Canada
- United States

This change is to reduce false positives when the end users of a network are dispersed all over the country. Many of the networks affected by this change are cell networks, which are often allocated across a wide area spanning one or more subdivisions.

The update will be reflected in the following products and services:

- minFraud Factors web service
- minFraud Insights web service
- GeoIP City database
- GeoIP Enterprise database
- GeoIP City Plus web service
- GeoIP Insights web service

{{< release-note date="2025-11-20" title="IP risk snapshot output added to traits object in the Insights web services">}}

We have added the [`ip_risk_snapshot`](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#schema--response--traits__ip_risk_snapshot) to the traits object in our GeoIP Insights web service and our minFraud Insights and Factors web services. This field contains the risk associated with the IP address. The value ranges from 0.01 to 99. A higher score indicates a higher risk.

The IP risk snapshot is not a replacement for the minFraud IP risk score (`ip_address/risk`). 

The IP risk snapshot is based on an analysis of historical risk on the IP address, while the minFraud IP risk score is a responsive data field that generates an IP risk score in real time based on the transactions you send and activity from across the minFraud network. 

minFraud customers may find the IP risk snapshot output useful to determine whether an IP address is risky based on historical activity versus a current, emerging issue. A lower `traits/ip_risk_snapshot` score combined with a higher minFraud `ip_address/risk` score would mean that the IP address is becoming risky in real time based on the traffic on your and other customers' networks. A high score in both `ip_risk_snapshot` and minFraud IP risk score would mean that the IP address has been risky for a longer time.

Client APIs have been updated to reflect this change.

{{< release-note date="2025-11-19" title="New anonymizer data added to web services">}}

We have added an [`anonymizer` object](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/web-services/responses/#anonymizer) to our web services. This object contains the anonymizer data previously found in the `traits` object together with new outputs.

Anonymizer data in the `traits` object is being marked as deprecated. However, for backwards compatibility, anonymizer data in the `traits` object will continue to be populated and the functionality remains the same. This will not be a breaking change. 

We recommend updating your integrations to use the new `anonymizer` object, which contains data points not found in the `traits` object:

| new data | description |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `anonymizer/confidence`                       | A score ranging from 1 to 99 that represents our percent confidence that the network is currently part of an actively used VPN service.| 
| `anonymizer/network_last_seen`                | The last day that the network was sighted in our analysis of anonymized networks. This is in the ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
|  `anonymizer/provider_name`                  | The name of the VPN provider (e.g., NordVPN, Surfshark, etc.) associated with the network. |

Client APIs have been updated to reflect this change, which applies to the following web services: 

- minFraud Insights
- minFraud Factors 
- GeoIP Insights

{{< release-note date="2025-06-16" title="EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE risk score reason added" >}}

We have added `EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE` as a new
[risk score reason](https://support.maxmind.com/knowledge-base/articles/risk-score-reasons-minfraud).

The `EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE` risk reason will be returned as either
`EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE raised the overall risk score` or
`EMAIL_DOMAIN_CREATION_DATE lowered the overall risk score` to clearly indicate
the effect the reason has on the score.

Please [email product@maxmind.com](mailto:product@maxmind.com) if you have any
questions. {{</ release-note >}}

{{< release-note date="2025-02-24" title="Risk score reasons out of beta" >}}

Risk score reasons have been officially introduced and out of beta as of
February 19, 2025.

Available for all minFraud service tiers for individual transactions on the
Transaction Details page and also via API for the minFraud Factors service, risk
score reasons provide specific and understandable reasons for why a risk score
is high or low, helping to uncover risk patterns for individual transactions and
the overall transaction stream, both at a point in time and over time.

[Read our blog post](https://blog.maxmind.com/2025/02/how-to-enhance-your-fraud-strategy-with-minfraud-risk-score-reasons/)
to learn about the ‘why’ behind risk score reasons, and how you can use the data
they provide to enhance your fraud strategy.

{{< release-note date="2025-02-10" title="No longer returning A1 country code in minFraud legacy web services" >}}

For minFraud legacy web services, we will no longer return `A1` as a country
code.

This change is due to the removal of long-deprecated fields in our GeoIP
databases.
[See our GeoIP release note for more information](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/release-notes/2025/#removal-of-deprecated-fields).
