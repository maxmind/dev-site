title: minFraud Release Notes - 2019 Archive
---

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-23" title="The USER_ID_REQUIRED error code is now ACCOUNT_ID_REQUIRED">
Our web services, including [GeoIP2 Precision web
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights) and [minFraud
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services), now return
the error code `ACCOUNT_ID_REQUIRED` instead of `USER_ID_REQUIRED` when the
account ID parameter is missing.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-17" title="Query usage report license key filter">
You can now filter by license key when viewing the [query usage
report](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/query-usage-report) \[login
required\] in your account portal.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-11" title="Toggle minFraud Transactions Access">
Account administrators can now enable or disable access to the [minFraud
Transactions
page](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/minfraud-interactive/transactions)
\[login required\], which is accessible from the account portal. You can manage
account access to this feature
[here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/manage-services) \[login
required\].

The minFraud Transactions page is used for review, dispositioning, tagging, and
exporting transactions. See our
[guide](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-interactive-manual-review-guide/)
for more info.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-12-11" title="Changes to Japan Postal Codes">
Effective December 16, 2019, we will return `1` as the last digit for all 7
digit postal codes in Japan. The last digit refers to [street-level
resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Japan) and should not
be relied upon for IP geolocation.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-11-08" title="Changes to Portugal Postal Codes">
Effective November 12, 2019, we will return `-001` as the last 3 digits for all
7 digit postal codes in Lisbon, Portugal. Our postal code resolution in
Portugal is accurate for the first 4 digits and we include the `-001` at the
end for backwards compatibility for customers to join the data with 7 digit
Portuguese postal code databases. We may extend this convention to other large
Portuguese cities in the future.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-16" title="Retirement of TLS 1.0/1.1 and unencrypted http minFraud requests">
We retired support for TLS v1.0/v1.1 and unencrypted HTTP requests to minFraud
services today, as part of our commitment to securing and protecting your data.
Please ensure you are using TLS v1.2+ to connect to MaxMind services.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-15" title="New static_ip_score output in web services">
The following output has been added to the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights), and [minFraud
Insights and Factors web
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services):

- `static_ip_score` – An indicator of how static or dynamic an IP address is.
The value ranges from 0 to 99.99 with higher values meaning a greater static
association. For example, many IPs with a `user_type` of `cellular` have a
score under one. Static Cable/DSL IPs typically have a score above thirty.

  This indicator can be useful for deciding whether an IP address represents
  the same user over time.

The `static_ip_score` output is present in the `traits` object.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-14" title="Final reminder of security-related retirements">
This is a reminder that we are retiring support for requests using TLS 1.0/1.1,
and unencrypted HTTP requests to MaxMind minFraud services on **October 16,
2019**. After October 16, 2019, these types of requests will always fail with
an error. Please update to TLS 1.2+ to avoid service disruption. You may need
to upgrade your technology stack to a later version, or make code changes to do
so.

[Contact us](https://support.maxmind.com/contact-us/) for support or if you
have questions.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-03" title="Improved cellular IP detection">
We have made improvements to how we identify cellular IPs for the
`connection_type` field provided in the [GeoIP2 Connection Type
database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-connection-type-database), and the
`user_type` field provided in the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights) and [minFraud
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services). Accuracy for
cellular identification should now be about 95% accurate globally.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-10-02" title="Account activity log">
You can now view a log of your MaxMind account activity, which includes a time
stamp, requester, and subject, for the each of the following actions:

- Creation of a new user
- Deactivation of a user
- User password changes
- Email address / username changes

Account administrators can see activity across the whole account, while
non-administrators will only see their own activity. You can find the account
activity log in your account portal under 'Account Information' or
[here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/activity-log) \[login
required\].
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-09-30" title="High risk IP country deprecation">
We've deprecated the `/ip_address/country/is_high_risk` output in [minFraud
Insights and minFraud Factors](/minfraud) (and highRiskCountry output in
[legacy minFraud services](/minfraud/minfraud-legacy)) because it provides
limited value. You can find the IP country in the `/ip_address/country/names`
output.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-09-19" title="New network and user_count outputs in web services">
The following outputs have been added to the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights), and [minFraud
Insights and Factors web
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services):

- `network` – The network in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)
associated with the record. This is the largest network where all of the
fields besides `ip_address` have the same value.
- `user_count` – The estimated number of users sharing the IP/network during
the past 24 hours. For IPv4, the count is for the individual IP. For IPv6,
the count is for the /64 network.

Both of these outputs are present in the `traits` object.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-09-16" title="Planned warning interruption (September 2019)">
**8-hour interruption of old TLS and unencrypted minFraud requests on September
25, 2019**

There will be a planned service interruption for all requests to MaxMind
services that use TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, and for unencrypted HTTP requests
to MaxMind legacy minFraud services (e.g. minFraud Standard, minFraud Premium,
Proxy Detection web service, IIN service). **This will take place for up to 8
hours from 14:00-22:00 UTC on September 25, 2019.**

During the interruption, requests using TLS v1.0 and v1.1 and unencrypted HTTP
requests to legacy minFraud endpoints will fail with an error.

To avoid service interruption, you may need to upgrade some part of your
technology stack to a later version, or you may need to make code changes. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to [contact
us](https://support.maxmind.com/contact-us/). Additional info is available on
our
[blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/04/12/important-updates-about-tls-v1-0-v1-1-unencrypted-http-requests-and-the-legacy-minfraud-soap-api/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-08-29" title="IP and email tenure deprecation">
Effective August 29th, 2019, we have deprecated the `/subscores/ip_tenure` and
`subscores/email_tenure` subscore outputs in the minFraud Factors service
because they provided limited value. The subscores will default to 1 and will
be removed in a future release. The IP tenure is reflected in the overall risk
score. The user tenure on email is reflected in the `/subscores/email_address`
output.
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-08-21" title="Improved business IP detection">
We have made improvements in how we detect business IPs for the user type field
provided as part of the [GeoIP2 Precision Insights web
service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-insights) and [minFraud
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services).
Approximately 1% of residential IPs were recently corrected to the appropriate
business user type as a result of these improvements.
</ReleaseNote>

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-08-05" title="Retirement of legacy IIN (BIN) API service">
We are discontinuing the legacy IIN (BIN) API on **January 31, 2020** in order
to focus development and maintenance efforts on our core services. This means
that the service will no longer function if you are querying the URL below:  
[https://minfraud.maxmind.com/app/bin_http](https://minfraud.maxmind.com/app/bin_http)

Please note that we continue to support the [IIN (BIN) look-up form on our
website](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/minfraud/iin/lookup)
\[login required\], so that remains an option for your use. If you require an
API because of volume considerations, we recommend either using our [minFraud
Insights API](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/minfraud/iin/lookup)
(IP address is a required input field) or integrating an alternative
commercially available solution.

services that use TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, and for unencrypted HTTP requests
to MaxMind legacy minFraud services (e.g. minFraud Standard, minFraud Premium,
Proxy Detection web service, IIN service). This will take place for up to 2
hours starting at 14:00 UTC on the three dates below:

- Monday, July 29, 2019
- Wednesday, July 31, 2019
- Friday, August 2, 2019

During the interruption, requests using TLS v1.0 and v1.1 and unencrypted HTTP
requests to legacy minFraud endpoints will fail with an error.

To avoid service interruption, you may need to upgrade some part of your
technology stack to a later version, or you may need to make code changes. If

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-07-22" title="Disable IP Risk">
You can now manage a list of IP addresses and networks that you want to exempt
from IP risk scoring. This is helpful when the IP address is known to be
unrelated to the end-customer, such as when you have transactions coming from a
call center or agent. Adding an IP address or network to the exclusion list
will ensure IP risk is neither calculated nor considered when determining the
riskScore for transactions associated with excluded IPs. [Learn
more](https://support.maxmind.com/minfraud-faq/minfraud-services/how-can-i-exclude-an-ip-address-network-from-being-used-for-risk-scoring/).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-06-14" title="Initial release of minFraud-node">
We have added Node.js as a MaxMind Supported minFraud API
([NPM](https://npmjs.com/package/@maxmind/minfraud-api-node),
[GitHub](https://maxmind.github.io/minfraud-api-node/)). It provides an API for
the [minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors
services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services).
</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-04-18" title="Security-related retirements 2019">
In order to ensure your data is as safe and secure as possible, we will be
retiring support for TLS v1.0 and 1.1, unencrypted HTTP requests to our legacy
minFraud services, and our legacy minFraud SOAP API in the coming months.
Please see our
[blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/04/12/important-updates-about-tls-v1-0-v1-1-unencrypted-http-requests-and-the-legacy-minfraud-soap-api/)

</ReleaseNote>

<ReleaseNote date="2019-04-08" title="2FA release">
To enhance the security of your MaxMind account, Chrome users can enable
two-factor authentication (2FA). You can now add and require a (FIDO U2F)
security key on top of your account credentials for a more secure log-in. See
our [support center user
guide](https://support.maxmind.com/two-factor-authentication-2fa-user-guide/)
for information on how to set up 2FA.
